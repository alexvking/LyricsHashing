All Gone Wrong 
Wanna tell a story 'bout a girl named Sheila
Lovely li'l thing but a bit of a dreamer
She's been married for three long years
Got three children and they're all little dears, but
Now she's bored with her married bliss, so
She goes out on the town, has a bit of this and that
The guy meant nothing, one night stand
Test turned blue, got much more on her hands
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong, and
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong, and
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong
It's all gone wrong
Derrick knew she worked at the supermarket
So while out on a drive decided to go and park it
Down by the river, walk to the store
Never got the courage up to talk to her before, but
He'd been up practising all last night
Planning what he's gonna say, making sure it sounded right
As he turned the corner by the milk and orange juice
She's playing tonsil hockey with the spotty guy from fresh produce
Jon was a guy that fully understood, that
The car that you drive is an extension of your manhood
As you can imagine, never left no doubt
Enter the equation when he drove his Cadillac about
Pretty damn long, pretty damn wide
Two silver lightning bolts painted down the sides
Imagine his grief, pity his pain, when
Both broke down one morning and never started up again
Fred played guitar in his best mate's band
They knew that they'd go far, all they needed was a helping hand
While practising one evening, there's a knock at the door
Opened up to see a guy, no one there had seen before
Introduced himself as 'Bob the talent-scout'
Handed them a form, told them they should fill it out
Now they're still practising in Fred's back room
Owe ten thousand quid, Bailiffs will be calling soon

All She Ever Wants 
Wanna tell you 'bout a girl I know
For this we'll call her Sandy
She's got legs up to her armpits
And her voice is sweet like candy
She's an angel
Head over heels but you can't tell
You know you love her but
You wanna keep your distance
There's just one big problem
And that's her damn persistence
And I know her
It's just one smile bowls you over
And you may well put up a fight
But she's still gonna stay the night
It's all that she ever wants
And then she gets inside your head
You won't remember what you said
It's all that she ever wants
And then she crawls inside your skin
You won't know what a mess you're in
It's all that she ever wants
And no she hasn't got a clue
Of what the hell she wants to do
Well she's not even faithfull
But you don't even blame her
If you were that fine then
You would be the same and
You don't own her
But ask her nicely and she'll show ya
When you first met her
The match was made in heaven
Little did you know
You were the fifth one out of seven
But you still stay there
And you're still acting like you don't care
She's still deciding
What it is she wants to do
But you know that her long term plans
Don't include you
But you're still hoping
It's your special way of coping
She absent minded and
She may forget your name
But your caught up in her
And you love just the same
There's no denying
You know you're getting close to crying
She's inside your head, you won't know what you've said
She's inside your head, you might as well be dead

Angel With A Pint Glass 
I remeber when I sw you, you were standing by the bar.
I didnt now what to say to you, so I spied you from afar.
You're Like an angel with a pint glass, Aphrodite with a beer
I remember thinking at the time, "So what the hell's she doing here?".
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
If I asked you nicely would you want to take me home,
I've been staring at you for hours and I think that you're alone.
Oh, could you be my valentine, or can i have this dance,
Thing is you're so perfect, well I dont stand a chance.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
I know they say that love hurts, but you didnt have to hurt me,
I would have taken your word for it, I trusted you completely.
I got your number in my pocket, I could give you a call,
The only problem with that plan is I dont like you at all.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.

Best Mate's Girlfriend 
I've been thinking about my mate's girlfriend
In a way I shouldn't be
Wondering 'bout the way she'd look
Posing like they do in books
Wearing very little, except maybe a grin
I could bring a bottle her boyfriend I could throttle
And while he's out the way I can jump right in
'Cause
Wish that I was sleeping with my best mate's girlfriend
I don't wanna go
She want's me to stay
But, my mate is getting in the way
If he'd should go out to the kitchen
That would give me time just to get a kiss in
If he should go to the garage instead
Well that'll give me time to get her into bed
Do it on the double or we'll get into trouble
And he'll make a punching bag outta my head
I'm sure that I've seen her winking
And I'm sure she's thinking what I'm thinking
I'd sure like to get to know her better
Especially what lies beneath that sweater
Fed up of thinking about it in dreams
I wanna know what really lies beneath your jeans

Break Up 
Hey there's something I wanna share
I'll tell you even though you don't care
Think of all the good times you're gonna have
Don't dwell on the bad times that just makes me mad
Well the sun is shining bright today
Less weight on your head 'cos you managed to get away
Now you've got your freedom, now you've got your chance
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
Why can't you just look ahead
Stop dwelling on the bitchy things she said, I know
You've gotta walk before you run
Don't just dream it, go and live it
C'mon bring it on
Hey there's something you need to know
You'll get there, but things are moving kind of slow
Now it's time to try out, things missed in the past
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
Well there's hope in your heart today
Living for yourself and you know it's never been this way
Now she's out for good and it's time to sing and dance
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
But please take my advice
Don't try and act too nice
Because you don't get chances to make mistakes twice
Hey, there's one thing that's real clear
You're better off without her around here
Nice to have you back and having fun at last
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass

Disco Kid 
Well, don't follow me 'cos I ain't no saviour
Got bad habits, don't look good on paper

But I'm doing fine so it must quite suit me
No I know what it is that you're trying to do to me
But it won't work
Gotta find another way
Gotta find another way
Gotta find another way
Well people that know me say I'm lazy
That's not true, well OK, maybe
It's not just that I'm bone idle
The mentioning of hard work makes me go suicidal
I've been hearing lots of stories

Hey, what the hell is wrong with you
Come on and join the queue
If you wanna get off
Yeah, there's an invisible border
Come closer where it's warmer

Maybe we could be the ones to make you happy
Hell you never know you might even smile
Maybe we could be the ones to get a little bit of you and put it to some use
Even if it's only just for while
Hey, come on and join the party
It's only just started
So you haven't missed much
All that you want is peace and quiet
But we're kicking u a riot
In your own back yard
Hey, everybody now lets go

Ego 
Hey, Kate, you and me should make a date
To have a little loving in the back row
Tell your mum you're gonna have a lot of fun
But don't tell daddy, that's a no-no
Hope it won't offend, maybe you could bring a friend
We could have more fun with three
If she's up for some, you could even bring your mum
She's kinda cute and she's got a thing for me
All you ever think about is me, me, me
And I can understand it
My ego's got so big lately
Swear that you could see it standing on another planet
I would've thought you'd have noticed
My ego's too big
Yeah I'm the host with the mostest
My ego's too big
Don't tell me you haven't noticed
My ego's too big
Hi, I'm the host with the mostest
Hey teach, remember when you used to preach
'Gonna have to stop that, if you wanna do well'
As a rule always had to act a fool
But look at me now, shows you never can tell
Now you're finally listening to me, me, me
And that's not how you planned it
My ego's got so big lately
Swear that you could see it standing on another planet
Maybe you think we're guilty of having rock-star attitudes
Maybe you're just jealous 'cos you've seen our faces in the news
Maybe it's just that you're out of practise
Hell yeah! Taking that for granted
Spend most of the year, living out a suitcase
The only sleep we get is when we're travelling to the next place
Hell yeah! I miss my family
But I've got all my best friends right here around me
And it's worth for that one hour
Get up on stage and feel that power
Me and you have got this understanding
Better clear the floor
My ego's coming in for landing

Friend Called Fred 
I think I'm going slightly mad
It might be all the dreams I've had
It could be all the things I've seen
All the things I wish I'd been
I'd like to introduce you
My friend called Fred, you got one too
He's the guy who tells you what to do
He's the one who knows better than you
I kinda find it hard to sleep
So I try my hand at counting sheep
But all I got was repetition
You can't get to sleep by doing addition
My friend called Fred is always right
He gets the last word every night
But now that really is a pain
'Cause what he says is all the same
My imaginary friend
Many's the time I wanna kill ya
Know I shouldn'y moan
But you're always there when I wanna be alone
My friend called Fred is never bored
He just steals what he can't afford
And no he never gets the blame
'Cause he just uses a false name
Look at this guy who's stood by me
It's obvious he's out his tree
He's acting like a crazy man

And all you wanna do is get along
Helping people across the road and doing what the hell you're told

What ever happened to the way it used to be
Where all you wanted was anarchy
Where rules were only made to get 'em wrong
I don't know, maybe I'm bold, I don't like doing what I'm told
I don't really want to get along
I'm not saying it's bad , just that some things make me sad
When I think of them as dead and gone
People try and live too fast, just one life make it last
There's no need to rush to get along
I enjoy things I've got, even when they're not a lot
Main goal in my life is have a laugh
I don't know, even though I'm older
Still don't like doing what I'm told
I don't really wanna get along
I'm just here to have fun, not to dictate anyone

Go away
Far away

Live Another Day 
Woke up this morning feeling like I've been run over
My head feels like I've been going solo with a brick
Crawl to the bathroom, grab the sink, the shower's running
Takes all my will power to stop myself from being sick
I don't know why I always do this to myself
You would've thought I'd learnt my lesson ages ago
I don't know what the hell I got up to last night
But if it carries on I know I haven't got long to go
I'm not in the best of health
But I have done it to myself
I'm not in the best of health
But I can't help that
Went to the doctors
Said I'm coming down with something
And I'm afraid it might lead to a heart attack
He looked me over, gave me his expert opinion
Gave me two tablets and said
"Get lost and don't come back"
I know it's not what you wanna hear
But if you'd just lay off the beer
Then you would live to see another day
If this was a cartoon
Then this song might have a moral, something like
"Don't you go down the same road that I went"
But as it is I'm enjoying myself, getting wasted
Until I don't then the moral thing can go get bent!

Lyrical Content 
You're so intent with my lyrical content,
that you probably don't realise exactly what I meant.
It may not be up there with J.R.R Tolkien.
But at least you don't need a PhD to understand what I mean
If you're the kind of guy who reads between the lines,
you probably drive a Volvo car and read Financial Times.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose.
It's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.
My lyrical content
There's nothing wrong with writing total nonsense lyrics,
I don't have to please anyone, especially not the cynics.
If your the kind of guy who likes to know what's wrong,
I'd rather put a smile on your face and help you bounce along.
Nothing makes us happier than smiling, bouncy faces
so we have to get our music heard in lots of different places.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose,
it's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.
My lyrical content
Heard some people saying that you had a sense of humour,
there may well be some truth in that but I think it's a rumour.
Said I get most of my lyrics from Peter and Jane,
I tried using Thesaurus but the songs came out the same.
Like to think we're standing on the funny side of crazy,
our future's looking bright although the past's a little hazy.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose,
it's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.

Nothing To Hide 
You will come to realise that your life is like a book
Someone's always noting the route you took
But I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
If you've got somebody buried underneath your patio
You can bet your life that your neighbours know
And I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
All those things I've done
All those things I've said
I wanna tell you that I've got nothing to hide
I got no regrets
At least I haven't yet
I wanna tell you that I've got nothing to hide
OK there was a problem I had back in '92
But that got cleared up and the rash did too
And I want you to know
That I've got nothing to hide
I've been called a liar, a cheater and a whore
I've been called a slut and a whole lot more
But I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
I'm not lying and I'm sure
She didn't mean a thing to me
And nor did the other three
Skeletons in closets are common place I know
But please don't hang your dirty laundry on show
And I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide

No Woman No Cry 
[Al's Lyrics]
Do you remember a few years ago
When they used to play this song yeah?
We decided, it was much too slow
So we've gone and upped the tempo
We say
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
So we went back
Did a bit of thinking, did a lot of drinking too
And we came to this conclusion
If you want it, you gotta go for it, don't care 'bout who is who
And you've got the best solution
We say
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be just

Ode To Slimy Bassless 
You've got your Volvo and yor little mortgage.
All your things of value all wrapped up in storage.
You've got 2.4 children named Dick and Jane.

You've got a dog named Rover, a cat named Moggy,
You're wife wont let you in the car if it gets a little foggy.

You happy just to sit home, your feet up by the fire.
It's OK to spend all of your fridays down the pub,
But you should have drawn the line at joining the caravan club,
You'd Rather stay home and watch T.V. than come out and socialise with li'l ol' me.
I dont wanna be the one to say that you got boring,
But when you start talking people start yawning.

You think you're wifes at bingo but she's here with me instead,
You wouldnt misunderstnad her if you just listened to what she said.

Rockabilly 
You ever felt like you're gonna chuck up
You try to speak but it comes out mucked up
Well that's just the way she made me feel
I know I shoudn't, no I shouldn't pull her hair
But it's a kids sign of affection
And I still ain't got nowhere
I sat behind her in almost every lesson
She drove me mad with that gingham dress on
And those little ribbons in her hair
She had a brother in the year above her
So I wrote, told him that I bugged her
He got all my stuff stuck in a tree
Yes I confess, I may well be a pest
But I'm not gonna change, so let it go...
She had a brother and he threatened to hit me
So I turned round and ran home quickly
Hid under the stairs for quite a while
I like to remember my days at school
I always was the classroom fool
Best thing about playtime was kiss chase
Yelling swear words with your mates
Not finding out what it meant till it's too late
And you're grounded for the day
Giving your mate's an atomic wedge
Or finding pornos in the hedge
Ringing doorbells and running away

Room For Abuse 
We'd like to say a thank you to our mums and dads
And all our families for all of the support we have
We'd like to give a big thank you to all of our mates
And all the people that have let us stay, you treated us great
We'd like to give a special mention to some of the crews
Cool promoters, yeah, the ones that gave us extra booze
And thanks a lot to all the good, good bands we know
We know without you, there probably wouldn't be a show
Now for some, a select few
We'd like to give a big fuck you
You like to think you're so damn punk rock
But really you don't give a fuck
We aren't naming any names
'Cause we ain't playing silly games
Just cause you're so damn petty
Doesn't mean we have to be
Promoters that have ripped us off
'Cause the just want a bigger cut
People say we aren't trad ska
We never said that we are
We don't mind if you don't like us
Just fuck off, get on your bike 'cause
We won't argue, it's no use
It just gives us more room for abuse
A great big thank you to the skaters and the kids and the punks
And all the people that are always there down at the front
Thanks to the people at the gigs for coming to it
And all the head cases that always go mad in the pit
We wanna say a huge thank you for the tabs and beer
We know without you we wouldn't have survived the year
We wanna say a thank you if you lent a hand
We know without you that there probably wouldn't be a band
Now there's a few people that we wanna list
Please excuse us if there's any that we have missed
We wanna give a real special mention to Hogger
You treated us well man, you're like a big brother
We know without people out you, this would mean nought
We'd like to thank Chip, Phil and all the rest for support
If we've forgotten anyone that has helped us out
We'd like to thank you 'cause that's what this is all about

Roving Eye 
My mother told me that I would get stronger if,
I could just keep my attention for a little longer on
One girl, any girl, just a normal kind of girl,
take time to ponder but that girl, any girl,
I'll give anything a twirl, I tend to wander
and I wish I didn't have a Rov- ingeye
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..
When I go out drinking I try to be good but,
I find myself flirting with people that I know I shouldn't,
Tall ones, short ones, 'specially the taut ones, I love them all,
With their long hair, short hair wearing almost underwear, say less is more.
And I wish I didn't have a roving eye......
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..
Well I'm here to tell ya that it can be trouble,
If you're going steady don't bother going for the double,
It's hard not to look, like a fish on a hook, surrounded by ladies.
The best way that I find, to get that image out your mind, is talk about babies.
And I wish I didn't have a roving eye......

Santeria 
I don't practice santeria got no crystal ball
I had a million dollars but I'd spend it all
I could find that heina and that sancho that she's found
I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd smack her down
All I really wanna say
I can't say it's love I need
But my soul will have to wait till I get back and find
heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break and I got to live it out
I swear that I really wanna know
All I really wanna say is I got mine and I make it
Yes, I'm comin' up
Tell sanchito that if he knows what is good for him
he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to put that barrel straight
down sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass
What I really wanna say is there's just one way back
And I'll make it but my soul will have to wait

Second Rate 
[A duet w/ Laila Khan of Grimace]
I love the way
You never stop your frowning
But if I saw you drowning
I wouldn't waste my time to rescue you
I love the way
You eat soup with your fingers
The way your odour lingers
For hours after you have left the room
Love the way that even though we fight
We know that it'll be all right
I know why we get on so great
We're second rate
Love the way
You never give up trying
But when you're old and dying
I won't be the one to care for you
I love the way
You live life on the sofa
You're as lively as a coma
I should've told you long ago we're through
Love the way that even though we fight
We know that it'll be all right
I know why we get on so great
We're second rate
We're OK
Oh, you really think so?
To be honest I just don't know

Here comes that guy with shiny teeth. A nicer guys easy to meet.
Nuge you with a bony elbow and tell you something you dont wanna know.

If I hear much morecrap them my ears gonna melt.
By the end of the night it'll end in a fight, I just can't help myself.
He's got his tan straight from a tub, it glows bright orange in a club.
Talk the hind legs of a donkey, his voice drones on its all inione key.

Wake Up Call 
I must admit I hate the mornings
I wish that they had never invented it
And skipped straight to the evening bit
It would make much more sense 'cos
Nothing ever happens in the morning
You sit around it can get quite boring for some
And you never get anything done
'Cos you're feeling to bad
I wanna share with you a little problem
I have trouble getting out of bed
I'd rather just sleep instead
Oh God I hate mornings
I have to have at least a cup of coffee
If I haven't, don't bother talking to me
In fact make that two or three
Before you try to approach me
When I do wake up it's never worth it
Cold pizza, beer and fag butts by the bed
There's a battle going on your head
Mornings are so overrated
What I wanna know, what I gotta know
Is why the hell I got up out of bed
When I could be laying in and sleeping instead

Well you need someone to show you life ain't that bad
Stop moaning, your whinings driving me mad.

But its really dull 'cause you haven't got the history.

Theres plenty of people in this world who'd like the life that you got.

Stop moaning, your whinings driving me mad.

Braided Hair 
Yo we was talking earlier and I was telling you talking bout life
I feel like life is like braided hair
Its sorta like twist you know
Bout braided hair like twist
You know three strands twist together
Ultimately you get to where you wanna get to
From the same dirt from the heels of my ancestors
The naked roads and the fields where the pain festered
And I wonder where the hold came from
In the deeps of my heart make me yearn for the drum
It's the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
It's the place where the floss was yearned
Gold teeth and bling ice on the ring baby sure
We've all got things that hang at the back
Things that make us cool,
Things that make us whack,
Things that make us mad
Things we wish we never had done
But they're just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids our hair
Until we all get there
I like that I don't know some mysteries
Ancient things and beginnings
Excited about the day when I don't have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease
It's the same place where the crosses burned
The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these braids with the twist and turns so
Walking in the race of life
Looking for my own pace
Not always wanting to but I have to
Sometimes feeling like I've bitten off much more than I could chew
But the wind goes though my hair
Lifts me up with ease not a crease
Hair full of grease no weave embracing me
It's you I see
I am you and you are me I see yeah
I am you and you are me I see
We might survive as brothers ye

My Culture 
I'm the sum total of my ancestors 
I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me.
-Maxi Jazz: 
When I look back over the years 
at the things that brought tears to my eyes 
papa said we have to be wise 
to live long lives 
now i recognise 
what my father said before he dies 
vocalise things I've left unsaid 
left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where i can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestory 
Givin'me continuity 
Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
would you rather I quit 
come with the other shit 
making people's hips sway 
lip service I pay but i'm nervous 
i pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
like a lifeline I light lines cause my compassion is deep 
for the people who fashioned me my soul to keep 
and this is who i happen to be 
and if I don't see that I'm strong then I wont be 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
to my sweet grandfathers face 
in his resting place 
I make haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
for my culture

Hello Dad, remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you reduced to tears 
Dad I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that's right my name's Bob 
I'm the one who landed the popstars job 
I'm the one who you told : look, don't touch? 
and the kid who wouldn't amount to much. 
I believe in the senses out of sound 
I have always been too loud 
wont you help me drown it out? 
I'm what I feel 
and what I'm feeling is surreal 
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel s'always digging in my heels. 
Now I got the faith to 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
water to air 
you're on your feet again 
your feet again. 
- Maxi Jazz: 
Hah, lace up your booty 
Going back to the roots continue my interlude 
Feed freaking for loot 
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now 
and your forefathers further know How 
but now what happened to the world without the hatred 
Use your head if the needle is wise be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom yours by best 
spreading the lords word over this broad earth

And to all of you I'm just another ghost dude
Floating along haunting pointlessly
Seems everyone is haunting something but me
Everyone is haunting me

But when I take off my white sheet
It's then I become unseen
I'm exposed without the blindfold of lies
Because those two holes are too small for human eyes
And I'll walk, not float to oblivion
Because that's who I am, not for the nation
Everyone is haunting me

If you don't know I'm gonna let it be known, Im still in the penetration zone

Head's always cloudy, words is lies

Sipping life from a jack daniels bottle of sin 
Daydreaming fazes walls caving in

Life In The Suburbs 
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Now my dad bought the system, American dreamer
Bought a new home and a brand new Beamer
But it didn't long for things things to fall apart
Because the system that he bought has no heart
From the bills for days hes got blood shot eyes
The American dream was a pack of lies
6 months later Municipal court
Divorce time baby, child support
I went from home cooked meals to TV dinners
No more little Mike now its the punk,the sinner
There's no cash back cause there was no receipt
Man suburban life aint the life for me
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Gave in a little deeper to the third degree
More drugs, real punks, and wannabe's
Soldiers of the burbs all feel deceived
America! What? Land of the green
Now you got problems I got mine too
There's not enough cops for my whole crew
Cause when we drink we drink to get away
To elevate from this world of hate, never perpetrate
I don't want no degree selling herbs on the burbs
On every street
No real jobs for the PTB, So what's it gonna be?
Grand minority!
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Now broken homes inside every house
Neighbors yellinh, can't work it out
I said beaten wives, tweaked out nights
what a feeling ooh what a life
Now you cant turn back the hands of time
So let me tell you about the highest friend of mine
His name is Greg , king of the crops
deep dark axe,hates all preps
Philly blunt placed behind his ear
Two young girls and a Heineken beer
And this is just and everyday thing
Dad comes home telephone rings
Its lenny and you know hes riding rich
Leapin' like some frogs trunk full of hogs
Trunk full of skates, dirt bikes and rakes
What ever we could get we was gonna take
Just like the pirates of the Caribbean
Neighborhood watch don't like what they're seeing
Ha ha ha we got it like that

SuperGirl 
o well here is me on tragedy
i always want whats out of reach
she pulles dyed brown hair back and signs
so fuck that night out with the guys

the telephone doesnt scare me anymore
your home and i am here alone my dear
always stupidly sarcastic my hyper spastic superhero grl
so break the bruised monogamy
and let him fade to memory
your erotic wet atomic eyes keep reoccurrin in my mind
do me a favor please and touch your lips to mine...

With You 
It dosen't matter what we do 
just as long as I'm with you 
I'd do the same thing every day 
I've never felt like this before 
you keep me coming back for more 
and you know I meant to stay 
I think about when we first met 
the night I never will forget 
I couldn't keep my eyes off you 
A classic case of boy meets girl 
you smiled at me and changed my world 
now I feel that way times two 
When you hang out with me tonight 
I'm sure my day will be alright 
if I see your pretty face 
And every second that goes by 
I think of all the reasons why 
my life gets better everyday 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
It dosen't matter what we do 
just as long as I'm with you 
I'd do the same thing every day 
I've never felt like this before 
You keep me coming back for more 
And I hope you feel the same 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you

Deal With It 
...and we go!
When I woke up on the sunset when it really should be dawn,
I thought I had no brains...when I really had no brawn.
Took it from the bottom, I should take it from the top,
I had another thrill, had another thrill when I thought I had my lot
Well I don't know what I do because I do as I know,
I gotta show for what I've got or I cannot find home. Whhhoooooaaaaoooohhh
(Ya gotta) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deeeeeeeeeeeeal...
I rolled a thought around my eyes, it should be in my head,
Got buried in Nevada...when I wasnt even dead.
All around me were the adults asking kids for cash,
When I saw a green police car, I thought I'd make a dash.
Well I don't know what I do because I do as I know,
I gotta show for what I've got or I cannot find home. Whhhoooooaaaaoooohhh
(Ya gotta) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deeeeeeeeeeeeal...with it.
Ya Deal with it, woahoohhoohh,

So Wrong So Long 
So tell me why you're here,
Do you still hold me dear?
When you're the one that walked away from me but that's okay,
Did you think all this through?
I thought about it too,
But I can't waste my life away on love that isn't true.
Are you still holding on?
When I did I was wrong,
To think you'd ever take another chance of losing me.
So now where do we stand?
You say that I'm your man,
But you won't tell me everything,
And I don't think you can.
I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.
Memories of yesterday,
All the things I couldn't say,
To make you understand how I feel now,
And time is moving way too fast to sit and contemplate the past again,
But I'll thank you always!
GO
I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.
Always, and I'll thank you always.
Always, and I'll thank you always.

Another girl to make me feel alright
There could be no other girl here but you
May be you will understand that I love you
Everywhere I look around I see your face

OH NO
Wish there could be something that I could do
Coz tonite baby I'm gonna party all nite

If I love you more
I'm really wasting my time
Everybody tells me that you have found another
So tonite is the nite I'm gonna party all nite
I'll try to live my own life

You'd always tell me that I'm the one for you
I believe in everything that you did

Everywhere I look around I see your face

At The End 
remember back in 93'
it was him and him and you and me
we all hung out in the hallway
remember our good old school yard days
we didnt care about time or money
we just had fun and played hookey
we all got closer together
we treated eachother like brothers
but as the time went by, ive come to realise
our friendships not the same
theres really no one to blame
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good
here we are, staring at
the end of brother hood
we always had eachothers back
no matter what differences we may of had
we all went out separate pathes
just thinking about it makes me sad
why dont we go on our friends
it isnt that bad, its at the end
what about all those times
brother hood is a crime.
but as the time went by, ive come to realise
our friendships not the same
theres really no one to blame
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good
here we are, staring at
the end of brother hood
and all this time,
ive been thankful for having friends like you
it will never get to my mind,
as you, this is what it comes to
but i just have to face the facts
that nothing in this world is really meant to last
here we are, its where were at.
here we are again.
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good

No fear at all, no sin 
The illusion do not need 
Every moment is the last 
To be dead for next time 
Love the death as the life 
Constantness is the right 
Love the Death as the Life

Every form is different, separated one 
Love to be in joy, beginnig in end

Comme une peau sur la peau dans le noir
Accroupie sur le sentier

Veux tu venir avec moi
Rechercher ce bruit si rare et si doux
Je te guide de ma voix
Au travers des herbes folles
C'est un pige de sauvageonne
Une promesse  tenir cette fosi
Laisse les voix qui t'appellent
Contenter les innocents
Au dessus de l'eau
Y'avait un bateau
Si beau si grand si loin
Au dessus de l'eau
Sur le grand miroir
Si blanc, si chaud, si noir

Quand tu viendras avec moi
Mlanger tes traces et perdre ton souffle

La nuit qui pousse le jour
Elle vient chercher ses rveurs dans le noir
Comem chaque soir elle est l, y'a plus qu'a
Assez de bruit, assez de gris
Assez de rues assez, ca suffit
Les jeux des enfants se sont eteints fatigus

C'est elles qui guettaient mon retour au pays du temps perdus
Assez de bruit, assez de rues
Assez de gris assez, ca suffit
Assez de dire oui quand c'est non, assez suffit
Assez de cris et de nuits sans sommeil

Oh laissez moi aller
Courir sur les sentiers
Fouler l'herbe mouille
J'entends les projets qui m'appellent
Ils se plaignent de la poussire
Et des journes trop remplies tard dans le soir
C'est elles qui me cassent et me brisent mon retour au temps perdu

Faire s'envoler tous ceux

On peut souffler
Aussi fort tous ensemble
Essayons la paresse
La dernire de nos armes
On veux souffler

La meilleure des matresses
Pour lui qui les avait toutes perdues.

Les Glycines 
Sur les murs y'avaient des glycines
Sur les murs y'avaient des glycines
Toi tu portais un tablier bleu
Toi tu portais un tablier
Toujours le nez dans tes bassines
Toujours le nez dans tes bassines
En ce temps-l on se parlait peu
En ce temps-l on se taisait
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Parat que cousin et cousine
Parat que cousin et cousine
Ca ne doit pas s'aimer d'amour non
Ca ne doit pas parler d'amour
Alors on parlait du beau temps,
De la pluie et des fleurs des champs
De la vendange et du labour mais
On ne parlait jamais d'amour
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Puis je suis parti en usine
Puis je suis parti en usine
Je ne voulais pas tre fermier moi
Je voudrais tre le premier
Merci beaucoup petit Jesus
J'ai bien manger et j'ai bien bu
Je suis aim ou respect moi
On me dit "vous" pour me parler
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Pourtant quand je vois des glycines
Pourtant quand je vois des glycines
J'ai envie de les arracher moi
J'ai envie de les arracher
Parat que t'aurais eu deux filles
Qui font partie de ma famille
Mais comme l'amour ne me dis plus rien
Elles n'auront jamais de cousins
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de la haine mais a viendra

Le Silence 
Quand le plancher de la scne
Qui est sous nos talons
Aura brl aux grands chantiers de la raison
Quand on se sera essoufls
A vouloir tout casser
Quand pour survivre
Il n'y aura qu'une seule faon
Quand on aura dpos une gerbe  nos rancoeurs
Quand le temps sera revenu
De rentrer dans le rang
Le silence, silence est d'or
On s'crase encore plus fort, toujours plus fort
A qui les torts,  en rveiller nos morts
Le silence, silence aidant
Ceux qui mouftent seront de jeunes morts
Pour la nation, au nom de l'ordre
Il y aura mon nom
Le silence, silence nous guette
Le bruit qui coure, nous inquite
Toujours plus fort, encore plus fort
Oh, je crie encore plus fort

Les Petites Gosses 
Quand je suis parti c'?tait des petites gosses
Elles roulaient leurs tresses en chignons de n?goce
j'aurais pas pens? que je les aimerais
Les copains m'ont suivi sur un bout d'chemin
Quand on est arriv? sur le quai je crois
La premi??re fois qu'on se serrait la main
Dans les r??ves que je faisais
Ca commen?ait bien comme
Ca commen?ait comme ?a
J'ai tourn? longtemps tout autour de la terre
Dans un sens et puis l'autre et m??me ? l'envers
j'ai vu de l'or et les marchands de passes
J'ai appris des mots dans des langues sucr?es
Je les recitais pour ne pas les oublier
C'?tait sans compter que je me mentais
Dans les r??ves que je faisais
Ca se passait bien comme ?a
Ca s'passait bien comme ?a
Tous les souvenirs du monde je les donne
Je les echange aux passants pour avoir su regarder
Pour avoir su me garder
Une petite gosse, une poup?e
A tenir dans mes bras
On reveint toujours pour refermer les yeux
Pour me faire rentrer faut dire y avait pas mieux
J'avais pas pens? que je les aimais
A rester, au comptoir comme dans un bocal
A m'imaginer en les regardant passer
Le samedi soir, leurs chignons d?faits
Dans les r??ves que j'ai pu faire
Ca finissait pas comme ?a

Le Train 
C'tait pas seulement pour voir la mer
Que j'tais l, rendez vous au quai
J'avais dans l'sac, et j'avais pas l'air
Un petit refrain qui s'tait roul dans le bruit
Oh je te donnerai mes nuits
Et la chaleur de mes deux seins
Je te donnerai mes folies
Comprends moi bien ce n'est pas rien
Ne m'attend pas en vainqueur
Je ne veux pas d'un dompteur
Je ne veux pas d'un seigneur
Ca disait a aussi
C'tait pas seulement pour voir la mer
Que j'ai pris le train au milieu de l'hiver
J'avais pens que t'allais me trouver
Pour mon petit refrain mieux que le bruit du train qui repart
J'allais te donner mes matins
Mes jours de fte et mes chagrins
Fidlit de mes deux mains
Comprends moi bien ce n'tait pas rien
Si le train s'emballe, on s'excite un peu
Chaque fois que l'on aime on meurt un petit peu
Dans le hall de gare les gens qui s'etalent
Jusqu'au prochain dpart ...
Je reprends mon train  l'envers
Snas avoir regard la mer
Sans dballer tous les secrets
Rangs au fond de mes paquets
j'ai le grondement des machines
Et le son du coup de sifflet
Comprends moi bien, oh ce n'tait pas rien ...

Bouffaient nos fils le jour de leurs 15 ans

Sortis de nos draps

Les rues du village s'allumaient d'un coup
A six heures moins le quart
Les portes ouvertes de la grande usine
Bouffaient nos fils bien avant leurs 15 ans
On se lve trop tt
On sait plus quoi faire
Dans le caf des vieux
Les mains dans nos poches
Cachent nos poings noirs

10 things I hate about you poem
I hate the way you talk to me, 
and the way you cut your hair.
I hate the way you drive my car, 
I hate it when you stare. 
I hate your big dumb combat boots 
and the way you read my mind. 
I hate you so much it makes me sick,
it even makes me rhyme. 
I hate the way you're always right, 
I hate it when you lie. 
I hate it when you make me laugh,
even worse when you make me cry. 
I hate it when you're not around, 
and the fact that you didn't call. 
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, 
not even close
not even a little bit 
not even at all.

Cruel To Be Kind 
Oh I can't take another heartache
Though you say you're my friend
I'm at my wits end
You say your love is bonafide
But that don't coincide
With the things that you do 
And when I ask you to be nice
You say you gotta be
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind
Well I do my best to understand dear
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why
I pick myself up off the ground
To have you knock me back down
Again and again
And when I ask you to explain
You say you gotta be
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind
Well I do my best to understand dear
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why

To have you knock me back down
Again and again
And when I ask you to explain

Even Angles Fall 
You've found hope
You've found faith,
Found how fast she could take it away.
Found true love,
Lost your heart.
Now you don't know who you are.
She made it easy,
Made it free,
Made you hurt til you couldn't see.
Sometimes it stops,
Sometimes it flows,
But baby that is how love goes.
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.
It's a secret no one tells;
One day it's heaven, one day it's hell.
It's no fairy tale;
Take it from me,
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.
You laugh, you cry, no one knows why
Behold the thrill of it all...
You're on the ride
You might as well
Open your eyes
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.

One Week 
It's been one week since you looked at me,
cocked your head to the side and said: "I'm angry!"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying:
"Get that together, come back and see me."
Three days since the living room.
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you.
Yesterday you'd forgiven me,
but it'll still be two days 'till I say I'm sorry.
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink,
as I make you stop think.
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman.
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss.
I like the sushi, 'cause it's never touched a frying pan.
Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes.
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value.
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits.
You try to match wits.
You try to hold me, but I bust through.
Gonna make a break and take a fake.
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake.
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours.
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
the vertigo is gonna growm 'cause it's so dangerous
you'll have to sign a waiver.
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad.
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral.
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will.
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve.
I have a history of taking off my shirt.
It's been one week since you looked at me,
threw your arms in the air and said: "You're crazy!"
Five days since you tackled me.
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees.
It's been three days since the afternoon.
You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon.
Yesterday you'd forgiven me and now I sit back
and wait 'till you say you're sorry.

like Sting I'm tantric, like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy.
Like Kurasawa I make mad films.
Okay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a Samurai.
Gonna get a set a' better clubs.
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs.
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing.
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon,
'cause the cartoon has got the boom anime babes
who make me think the wrong thing.

dropped your arms to your sides and said: "I'm sorry!"
Five days since I laughed at you and said:
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do!"
Three days since the living room.
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me 'cause it'll still be
two days 'till we say we're sorry.
It'll still be two days 'till we say we're sorry...
It'll still be two days 'till we say we're sorry...

Outside,
All around me,
Really sleazy,
Then it hits me
Don't tell me,
You can see,
What It means to me,
Leave me
Don't tell me,
You can see,
What it means to me,
Leave me be

10 Things I Hate About You
The Weakness In Me ( Joan Armatrading ) 
I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you get my attention
Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie and I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I mean to see you
And I mean to hold you, tightly
Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep
If I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
And I need you, and you
Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie and I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I mean to see you
And I mean to hold you, tightly

10 Things I Hate About You
Your Winter 
The grey ceiling on the earth
Well it's lasted for a while
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
I've been acting like a child
Your opinion, what is that?
It's just a different point of view
What else, what else can I do?
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry, but what for?
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself,
don't want to hurt you
Why do you choose your pain if you only knew
How much I love you love you
Well I won't be your winter
And i won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
Old picture on the shelf
It's been there for a while
A frozen image of ourselves
We were acting like a child
Innocence and in a trance
A dance that lasted for a while
Read my eyes just like a diary
Oh remember, please remember
Well I'm not a begger, but whats more
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I dont want to hate myself, dont want to hurt you
Why do you choose that pain if you only knew
How much I love you, nooo
Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
We can be forgiven
And I will be here ohh
No, I won't be your winter (i wont)
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
I won't be your winter (i wont)
And i won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here

Wait the fact you did it.
Don't admit it.
Won't make you innocent.
Fate finds you wicked.
Turns you victim for everything you have done.
So justify the reason to kill.
Reason to kill.
I bet you will.
Find no one but yourself.
But yourself.
I wish you well.
Oh what tangled webs we weave.
When we practice to deceive.
I know you well.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Our actions and motives.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
I just don't get it.
How you managed to justify who dies.
Like judge and jury.
Your the very one who crucifies.
Don't get your hands dirty to kill.
Use someone else.
Know all your lies are measured in hell.
I wish you well.
Oh what tangled webs we weave.
When we practice to deceive.
I know you well.
I know you well.
Actions and motives.
Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Our actions and motives.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Can't bleed out!

Well water thicker than blood.

Your failure to find compromise.

You play the part of the fool so well.

All Your Lies 
Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention please.
He who lusts through life for excess in this world.
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul.
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance.
You're full of pride.
Full of pride.
Full of pride.
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life.
Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why.
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse.
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence.
Ignore the signs.
Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Bend the truth till you can't find it.
Find it.
Twist your lies till you don't mind them.
Mind them.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
Demise.
From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.

Vanities of business built to please the unique
Silicon and stars collide; the rest will fall at night

Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your eager will kill what's left inside

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
Touch with frustrated lips
Love is like starting over
With every step engraving the problems of memories
Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
Drunks on failures regrets
Letters of silence confess burdens within
Speaking as loneliness listens
While hopelessly feeling
Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
There's a definite pattern to our behavior
Somehow the end draws us closer
Casting out my visions of nine
Casted out let ten die with time

Casted out I'm watching your eyes run dry

I can't seem to change you or open up your eye's 
So go on and sing your sad, sad song.
I don't even blame you the routine is nice.
Nine to five and a suit and tie.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.
Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?
Life can't seem to teach you the safe caught is right.
So stray from the fight.
Don't you realize?
The daydreamers nightmare is to never even try.
You kind of slipped by.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.
Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.

Take a step back and find a way out of here.

Dying Youth 
Deep under the surface I keep the love.
Older and aware of a hidden universe.
I've prayed to be young, and prayed to be inspired.
The words of your tongue blister like fire.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
There is a glimpse of death in your eyes.
I'm not prepared to let out those cries.
I plead to stay young soon, but soon will be expired.
So lost in denial.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
Breach in her womb, sheltered from strife.
Bearing the gifts, and burdens of life.
I've prayed to stay young, but soon will be expired.
An age of innocence, long since gone.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
Those who are looking backwards, chose to live as statues.
Frozen, fractured, youthful laughter, fades.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
Fictitious styles of living
We've expected to work
But this is all your giving
Half of what your worth
Pigeon hold in battles
Overtones of snow in her clutch
Falling through lines
One more breath destroys the best of you
The death of you
Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
A precious gift embedded deep within your skin
But parasitic pleasures are closer than kin
Please expose your shadows
Such concerns are products of love
Falling in lies
One more fraud destroys our trust in you
Our love for you
Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
As you kiss the abstract
And pray it's everything you'd hoped for
The smell of her, the thrill of her
The fruit of her, the use of her
Is killing everything that you've worked for

Tension made of razors
Dragging across you
The flushing of eyes
Couldn't cleanse your abrasions
Deep inside consumed with guilt

Dream suspicious strangers over night

Silent movements mar reinjuring God

Briding a widow in spite of her venom

Three becoming two
Such a left in criminal
Only the mind of the temptress knows
Actions are my remorse for amnesia

Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and soul
Try and come to willingly embrace
Kharma's kiss of withering decay
Death feeds, Hell breeds
Subside in the Autumn
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Keep on fighting one died from burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and-
Silent beauty 
No one cares
Silent ending
No one is there

The Recipe 
Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall we decompose
Rest against the sore
Push breath and pull
Ripping out compassion
Instincts adapting
Sin sings a moan
In slides night
Unite and spread the heart apart
And smile of pain
I can't show my true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall we decompose
Prey on the masses
Conscience relapses
The less we think and
more we drink our actions are casual
While sin sings a moan
Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall
We decompose
Distance is safer than trust
Honestly honesty's a fable in love
Calloused
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel
I can't show my true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall we decompose
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel

Through The Iris 
Cherish
Two circular views of blue with a gray shade
So captivating
More than you know
False preceptions
That brought forth these questions of
Truth, love and hope
Now that you're injuring
I carry you with me just
Please hold on
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Love's not all lost
But it's nailed to my cross
And crucified all that I've held on
To be awaiting
Anticipating a touch such as yours
False affection
A spawn of neglecting
A love, lust, hoax
Please understand me
That now where you're standing
Is closer then I'd hoped
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Your Iris
Your Iris
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Disappear and dissolve

Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse

Waking Up 
Distance and space allow emotions to age into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Just in the way all your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight) distance away
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fear love

Change my attempt good intentions
Crouched over
You were not there 
Living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce 
Obvious tears
But I will not 
Hide you through this 
I want you to help them
And please see 
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt 
Die, withdraw 
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips 
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland 
This time you've tried 
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions 
Should I, could I 
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Crowned hopeless
The article read living wasteland
This time you've tried 
All that you can turning you red

Hide you through this 
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions 
Should I, could I 
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Heave the silver hollow sliver 
Piercing through another victim 
Turn and tremble be judgmental 
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste 
Eventually you'll one day know 
Change my attempt good intentions 
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Should I, could I

Back Lash 
Mesmorized by your beauty i feel powerless in your gaze
Ostracized, treated unfairly at night i dream of blood filled days
Because in this world
No one has your back
A lifetime of devotion
All i feel is had
What's the price of freedom what's the price of integrity
Should i suffer for your sins and live this life of agony
Because in this world
A lifetime is devotion
And all i feel is had
A generation of apathy with folk heros from infamy
Empty lives now have direction
Just one bullet changed perception
Kicked and beaten for so long pushed around
And told i'm wrong
With you in my sights i'm free no longer fear
But strength you see

Destiny Never Came 
I wasn't meant to be, no one sent for me.
Always told I was something more.
This destiny will destroy me.
Been rotting to the core.
Never once did I care of the plans that were made.
Never once did I cry at the end, or at my grave.
They pushed and pushed till I would bleed.
Not even once did I agree to all the shit they fed me.
Could never make a man succeed.
And I screamed, and I did shout.
They chewed me up and spit me out.
But here I stand with broken hands.
Pounding on the walls of fucking destiny.
Fuck your destiny.
Fuck your golden child.
Fuck your women and children.
Fuck you and die.
Fuck your plans for me.
Oh can't you see I never wanted a part of this shit that you have planned for me.
Destiny never came.

Dying In My Own Arms 
What makes you think that your death is secure?
That you won't die alone.
Your solace isn't something to seek.
It's a sign of the weak.
Who will save your rotten soul?
In time all memories will fold.
Ace down with your head in your hands.
You'll be dying in your own arms.
BROKE DOWN!!!
Left a wreck.
BURNT OUT!!!
A husk of a man.
WASTED!!!
But not nearly so close.
I'm dying in my own arms.
Do you think you have someone?
You will die alone.
Die alone motherfucker.

Hard Luck 
The classic struggle of good and evil
Has brought me to my knees
My mind is so filled with hate
One hundred demons possessing me
Your kind never inspired me
You never offered your hand
Just told me who i should be
But you don't know who i am
You say i dwell on the negative
Well it's a part of my life
Until you've tasted how i live
Keep your fucking advice to yourself
All that time you wasted
Preaching to the converted
A lifetime of hard luck
Still can't make me give up
Time has conquered youth
But the angers still inside
It doesn't come from hate
It's from a sense of pride

Way too fucking slow
You never see my weakness
I never let it show
Buried so deep inside me
I can't remember where
On my way straight to hell
And i'll wait for you there
Where can i find the answers
I've looked everywhere
Drugs, religion, sin and penance
I've tried them all they're not the cure
I've been beaten down by life
But i'me still fighting abck
I want to die with dignity
Keep your tears i'm on track
Destined to go nowhere
Determined to get there first
Where can i find the answers
I've looked everywhere
Drugs, religion, sin and penace
I've tried them all they're not the cure

His father's son is now a man.
Before he stands a stranger in his eyes.
Through his life he never lent a hand.
Where does he stand in his only sons mind?
Where were you when we needed you the most?
You disappeared you coward.
Hide your head in shame.
You did no wrong?
You tried your best?
WELL YOU LIE!!!
You destroyed all she had ever worked for.
What have you done?
Look what you made.
Thanks for the pain I will take to the grave.
You must know but this time I never needed
You, must must know through the years I never needed
You, can see from my face I never needed...
How does it feel to have your honor shamed?
I know the feeling well.
I've felt the pain.
Another life you let your seed and died.
Now you're gone, never to return.
I see the way you hold the children these days.
No ties to them - the ease throw your past away.
I won't forget these scars you planted in my mind.
You will never hold my first-born.

How Can I Forget 
I guess it's been a year or two or three
I let myself forget who i'm supposed to be
Lived for myself no matter what was said or done
Didn't give a fuck if i offended everyone
Another day still living in the gutter
I never doubt i'm better than the others
My actions prove me wrong every fucking day
Just watch me contradict every word i say
I can't kick these drugs they're still kicking me
If i could leave it behind who the fuck would i be
Defined myself for years by the rules i broke
Another drink and i'll forget
If i can't remember how can i regret
Another pill and i'll forget
If i can't remember how can i regret
Another bundle and i'll forget

Cuz in this world of pain
Nothing breaks the memory of your touch
What was i thinking
I should have kept drinking
To flood you face from my mind
But now it's over and i'm sober enough
To know you fucked my mind
Love can seem like slow death
If it's not returned
You will feel your body and soul
Start to burn with desire
And unrelenting pain
The tears they cloud my eyes
I bite my tongue till i taste my blood
So you won't hear my cries
Hiding in my private darkness
I put you out of my mind
My fear of death being overcome
By my hatred for this life

In the place of gods, in the hands of fate.
I gave it all but I've been raped.
No friends ever came, no love for me.
I know that I'm free.
From the words, from the cancer, from their eyes.
From all the bullshit I despise.
From all the countless fucking lies.
You're all dead to me.
If I could I would stop your heart.
Not a threat, just a thought I do enjoy.
Do your best to keep me from you.
My broken dreams and shattered goals.
Stop the lies, we are not friends.
End of the line for your forked tongue.
Since I was young nothings more true.
Than what was told that golden clue.
She always said "Our blood ran deep."
And no one can compete...with the ties that you have with family.
Your trust should weigh so heavily on the ones who raised and cared for you.

Don't think it's a call, a plea for help.
I never asked anyone.
From what I've seen, from the look of things I can only help myself.
I had faith that I was loved by you.
But it has filtered through.
Seeping through my hands.

Left with no more than a glimpse of what you have become.

I'm already dead i just don't know it yet
Because you stole my heart a love i can't forget
Slowly dying when will i go
I wish i was dead i feel so alone

The pain it burns inside i suffer everyday
Still alive wishing i was dead like christ at the stake

I should have seen it loud and clear

just leave it all alone

something hangs out in the yard

I turned to look but found you gone
I can't believe what you have done
I watched the tears run down your face

What kind price will you now pay to make the nightmares go away
they follow you into the calm, there's no escape, something's wrong

Chameleon Song (Disappear) 
To be deceived in silence
by a loneliness shared with a heart gone wrong
it grows, speaking words made of stone
beneath them chameleons squirm
I thought you'd send your kiss to rescue me
now I can't even decide in what to believe
I hope you find him, I hope he's real
I hope you find him...before your love disappears
to seek an act of kindness
underneath the mask and the disguises worn
they burn like memories lost
lighting a path to her heart
I hope you're happy, I hope you heal
I hope you wake up...before your love disappears
to see the dreams inside her
slowly turning to rust
after another day
she sings, but her words have become
a tragic chameleon song

Somebody's Been Sleeping 
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
They ate up all my food
And I don't stand to search
Don't ell me it was a woman
Cause a woman don't eat that much
My brand new silk pajama's
They're rolled up in the chair
My mind ain't playing tricks on me
Now tell me is he still here
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Cigarettes in my ashtray
And I don't even smoke
Somebody's been in my best booze
I can tell cause the seal is broke
I left my bedroom slippers
Last night underneath of my bed
And now they're in my living room
And my bed was left unmade
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been eating my food
Somebody's been looking at my shoes
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed...

Dreams 
only now do you realize
as the tears pour from your eyes
whatever is left can never replace
whatever is lost whatever the price
don't regret the choices that you made
it's too late now
it's too late now
when all that's left is an empty shell
you start to think, you start to dream
embrace all you have known
be it truth or lies
let the truth stand alone
now you fell and steal kisses
what drives bringing blade to wrist

Hello, Moderater 
Look at yourself.
Sitting there, at your
Computer, reading this.
What kind of pathetic
Life are you
Leading, huh?
I mean, look at yourself.
How did you even land
This job? It must be your
Great circle of connections.
Or, dear God, it may be
That your the loser
Who created/designed
This whole derned site
And in which case,
I salute you man, cause you have
Bigger balls than me to actually
boast that on the Internet.
However, i am probably
Mistaken, and you actually
Like what you
Do for a living.
In any case, I just
Thought that you should
Know how pathetic your
Life has become.
P.S.
If youre looking for where you'll
be in five years,
look in the mirror and smile.
No, wiat, frown.

Read This (Everyone) 
I have a sick mind
And usually I would put 
Something completely 
Random here
As I did on the other
Song by "What Made
Miliwauke Famous" (check
it out, i think its good
lyrics writing seeing
as how its on the
spot)
But other than
That, im just writing
This becuase I know
You're probably smiling right
Now.  From person
To person it may vary
Why you are smiling,
But for
The most part its because
You are amazed that
Someone that
You have never met before
Is just
Writing in such a 
Personal way on some
Website in some crappy
Artists lyrics.
By the way, Ive never heard 
Of this
Band, or the Miliwauke
One either.  But i doubt this
Will even make it past
The verifiers of this site.
Goodbye.

I'll Hide
Away from the Sun
Inside
As Christ Burns
You are blinded by your bloodshot eyes
You are deafend by the screams of lost hope

How can you live like this
As the people around you fall to the ground
You close your eyes and close your mind there's nothing left to know.

The Beauty Of Blood 
tears shatter as they fall
1000 crystals to split the light
the beauty of the rainbow
to mask the blood that stains the ground
vision blurs and the ground shakes
children cry in their mother's arms
a flower can't drink from parched land
they ddrink the blood that stains the ground
the beauty of blood is in us all
the beauty of blood eats away at my soul
i've watched you die a thousand times
a thousand more and it still would be beautiful
you're beautiful to me

this can't be happening
please take me away

put me on display
when will this blood stained curtain be pulled
our blind eyes don't see the signs
young minds build on me mechanical design
will the hate stop in time
or do we just live to die
you are controlled by what you can't see
it makes life nothing
nothing but a show
built to burn

when will this blood stained curtain be pulled

Can We Talk 
last night I 
I saw you standing
and i started,started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only'cause so was I
And i've dreamed of you ever since
Now i've built up my confidence
Girl next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say
(Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name)
I started to write you letters
But i wanted to be more clever 
I wanted to get down and sweet talk to you
But just like a baby 
I could not talk
I tried to come closer
But could not walk 
And i think of it every night
How i just could not get it right 
If we ever come close again
I know what i'll say then 
(HOOK) 
Oh girl, one more chance 
With you again 
I will not let it go 
Oh please, give me just one more chance for love (HOOK)

Kitty Kat Max 
Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Well my kitty cat ran I was so sad inside
The feelings that I have I can no longer hide
I want him back as fast as I can
He's my little buddy and Im his friend
Without my little kitty I don't know what to do
I'm felling sad and blue
He has a little red nose and a fuzzy head
A soft couch to sleep on, he's quite well fed
Instead I will brush and pet him all the time
I think he really likes it cause he gives the sign,
A little nudge of his nose and a sandpaper lick,
Sticks his claws in my back and I scream aww shit 
But he doesn't mean to hurt I m gonna be real kind
Without my little kitty think I'm loosin my mind
I'm bribin other cats to search for Max, 
I Said, I'm bribin other cats to search for Max
I'm offerin things that they cant refuse
Like Purina cat chow and some soft beef chews
A little mousy and a ball of catnip
A bowl of cream and some tuna-fish dip
I think its kind of working cus they're searching around
Max is a homie and he must be found
I leave the windows open, I hope that he'll jump in
I've gotta see him soon, hes such a cute little thing
So if you're out there Max and you hear this song
Hey, little buddy, will ya please come home?
I called my man Bret to explain my situation
He said grab a pen and paper, start a new creation
Radio stations all across the nation will be down no doubt with your unique situation
I remember the days when I would go to bed
Wake up in the morning with Max on my head, my face so full of hair I'd want ta scream and holler
Unable because my mouth's full of flea collar
But, that's the fact, hes gone and Im blue
I wrote this little song, think it's the right thing to do
So, little girl if you can find my kitty 
Will you please bring him back to my part of the city
If you bring him back soon you get a sweet surprise
I'll kiss you right on the mouth and take a swim in your eyes
I think it's a fair fee so I hope youre down
My address is (something) P. O. Box a thousand clowns

Not The Greatest Rapper 
I wanna be down, yo, will you let me?
I get real close, I kiss her face real gently.
Don't sweat me girl youre everything I ever needed
And when I'm with you my heart starts to bleed
I plead and plead and plead and plead for a litle kiss
And if you say "okay" I just got my wish
On the town the night will be just right
I hold your hand but I wont squeeze too tight.
I feed you food that you've never eaten
I think about it and my heart starts beating
I look at you and it nearly wrecks me
I never met a girl who was so damn sexy!
A week later and some daisies after, 
You get a postcard from this silly rapper
And it says I'll be knocking on your front door,
Cuz I've never loved a girl like this before!
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But please baby, please baby be my girl.
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in this land
But I'll do anything if you'll hold my hand.
I pick her up and its raining heavy

Hear the shots pulling out all the stops 
While collecting mad props gotta ride it like a Caddy 
While your girl calls me daddy gonna party with Bacardi 
Gettin' loose you know we're naughty 
Pass the forty and the blunt I'm not a stuntman 
Look into my eyes and realize I am the one who can flow 
You know these waves as deep as the ocean 
And my cuts with unified were baptised in commotion 
Got this potion called game jumpin' out of my pores 
And if the mind is a weapon then my rhyme is a sword 
So all aboard the soul train these dice that I roll 
Man are comin' up kid I'm the one they call No-Name 
You can't see me in the shadows 
And when it comes to battle I'm Cadillac backed 9,999 prime time 
When we rhyme five dollar dime on the mind 
Make you stop look and listen and you'll still be missing mine 
I'm rollin' with the crown on my hood 
Good wood with a Louisville Slugger motherfucker 
Fuck around say hey batter batter watch a motherfucker splatter 
When I hear your teeth chatter makes this motherfucker madder 
Nigga got more game than Chutes and Ladders 
Had enough so ruff so tuff get your hands against the wall 
I'll call your motherfuckin' bluff now puff some herb 
You look disturbed left you layin' in the curb 
Nigga lost in my verb victimized by my word 
If you bring this you better mean this 
I drop genius at my convenience and your nigga never saw me 
So I know you'll never see this creepers 
Peeps in my click deep in this shit since the day we were born 
And we'll bounce if you trip not down with a stick 
Automatic got a crown on the horn

Got dropped had to say later to the traitors 
Cause that shit had to stop Cleveland's my spot 
Props and peeps beats bump in Jeeps jump in clubs

Love baby be my Caddy I'll call you Daddy Cadillac Daddy

Booya rest in peace it was nice when I knew ya 
Strictly business don't let it fool ya closed casket

Leggo my Eggo like Prego 
We're in there like Energizer goin' goin' gone so long 
Down with U.C. so forth and so on 
I want it want it want it does that mean I can't have it 
Pull a rhyme out of my mind like pulling that rabbit out of a hat 
Ain't that kind of strange the vocal line rearranged 
But the beat didn't change 
Order in the court cooperate for a quarter 
And you oughta realize we ride and bring disorder transporters crossing borders 
Life is short and getting shorter 
Sex and lies and camcorders order a whiskey and a water 
Raise a toast to Bone for bringing it home to the Erie shores 
See the world got shown where you're at

We're thuggin' but never thieving 
You were deceiving yourself when you thought we weren't

Exercise In True Love 
My heart broke for the last time last night 
When I saw her disappear into the moonlight chasing midnight 
As I sat paging through the newspaper reading about who's at war with who? 
Who's lying to who? who's beating who? 
I reached for my cup of coffee 
As black as the minds of men and the hearts of women 
And I felt an uncontrollable emptiness. 
I looked up and through the glass window 
Hazy with a blanket of industry 
When suddenly the most beautiful woman appeared 
Like a cherub familiar yet strange. 
I felt as if I knew her as well as my own secrets
Yet I knew nothing. 
I felt an urge to jump out of my seat and hold her 
Then I realized a beauty of this magnitude 
Need not be tarnished by the expectations of another 
Nor could she ever again be what she was to me 
At that very moment an ounce of faith 
For a soul drunk with apathy. 
It's strange how we instinctively 
Attempt to alter what we love 
Often spawning the antithesis of it's own incarnate. 
This masochistic ignorance defines our species 
And will ultimately lead to our demise. 
As for my love outside that window 
Untainted she walks alone. 
I hope you know 
I hope you know that I love you for 
Forever and when forever never comes 
You'll be in my arms together-together-forever-forever 
We are one 
We are one

You know it never lets up and if it gets you down 
Put on the crown now get your heads up 
I got my wing tips don't need a grip to collect my chips 
Forty sip equipped not to trip as I pimp the apocalypse off the rip 
And on the rise see through the messiahs lies 
Got to silence all the cries the destruction and the demise 
We try to make it better make some cheddar make some cheese 
Coming correct we respect T-H-U-G's 
And these are the warriors and poets with a prophecy 
And I love that Bizzy Bone when he says 
That nobody can stop me who shot me

But they don't mean as much as the streets do 
You know what I mean? 
Step up step up and speak your mind

Raise your forty if you're naughty 
If you feel me join my army 
Gotta bomb 'em with this track 
It's trauma that we pack 
Mad drama Cadillacs got that karma coming back 
So avenge the souls cause it's revenge that we hold in the highest regard 
We praise the gods of old so let go of my style 
You stole three cards and you fold 
Motherfucker don't you know Cadillacs broke the mold 
Hands up it's a hold up you never should of showed up 
Cadillacs plot and rock the block 
Until it blows up back to the top drop 
Game plan can't you tell we're gettin' tired of the same old thing 
Man check it out we're coming up for a take down 
And ol boy is 'bout to buckle under breakdown 
Stand up if you're down take a look to the future 
This generation gap can't be sewn with a suture 
So step off the toes of those that you stand on 
Looks like you're fallin' off without a damn thing to land on 
History repeats itself society defeats itself 
And egos won't allow us to learn from our conceited self esteem 
Is what it is that we gotta take back if they hit ya

You betta keep your eyes on the sparrow 
Return of the dragon heir to the throne

Team is the key contradictory to belief 
Believe that team equals victory 
Now lock it in the pocket and let the rhythm roll

Across The Fields 
Well they left then in the morning, a hundred pairs 
of wings in the light moved together. In the colors 
of the morning I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone. 
Across the marshes, across the fields below. 
I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below. 
If only to take me with them there, 
tell me the part that shines in your heart on the wind. 
And the reeds blew me in the morning. 
Take me along to the places you've gone when my eyes looked away. 
Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning. 
Tell me the part that shines in your heart and the rays of love forever, 
please take me there.

All That Never Happens 
She walks alone on the brick lane, the breeze is blowing. 
A year had changed her forever, just like her grey home. 
He used to live so close here, we'd look for places I can't remember. 
The world was safe when she knew him, she tried to hold him, hold on forever. 
For all that never happens and all that never will be, 
a candle burning for the love we seldom keep. 
The earth was raw in her fingers, she overturned it. 
Considered planting some flowers, they wouldn't last long, 
no one to tend them. It's funny how these things go, 
you were the answer to all the questions. 
The memories made her weary, she shuddered slowly, she didn't want to. 
As a distant summer he began to whisper, and threw a smile her way. 
She looked into the glass, liquid surface showing that they were melding, 
together present past. 
So where can I go from here? 
The color fading, he didn't answer. 
She felt him slip from her vision. 
She tried to hold him, hold on forever. 
So close forever, in a silent frozen sleep.

You were looking away from me, western skies calling you. 
Colors spilling, running dazzling you. 
I was looking the other way, voices call from the east, 
I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet. 
It could be I'm searching for a place so small with room for everything 
where worlds on worlds revolve. 
But how can we wait? I wouldn't hold you back. 
Suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me. 
I could say I was writing a song about you and me. 
Maybe that verse is yet to be found, but waits inside of me, 
a secret room a tangled web to unweave. 
But how can we wait knowing our ways, how can we hold on,

A big start running from me, I saw a world out sunning on my head. 
Turn the tables on me now. I would fall from heaven and ring your bell. 
Baby, catch me in the middle of a lie. 
The boys are out tonight, yeah the boys are out tonight. 
The big shots singin' from me, I saw a world out sunning on my head. 
Pity my heart signals: center of a storm inside my head. 
Center of my heart, center of my out of time simple mind. 
From the moon out my window a wink and a blink and a nod. 
Had a wish on a start but now it's falling. 
The boys are out tonight, big skies above me signal in my horoscope it said: 
never heed a caution, never fought a lover, 
never cross a street alone in the middle of a signal red, 
middle of a drinker's heart, middle of a big parade, a signal in my horoscope.

Young girl in my young girl days, thinking I could live for always.

Seasons pass like sand inside a glass and nothing, nothing returns. 
Standing with the friends I've made, I'll race them to the grave. 
Well who won, won the extra days?

Captured in his artist way before the memories fade away. 
To remember a face, and you're home or want to. 
Certain they would meet soon, paint a portrait of a family. 
Sigle light on, single way, single light away.

Green Children 
An August day in the hills of Spain, a pair of children emerged from a cave. 
The strangest sight there alone they stood, 
with skin of green and words no one had heard. 
The girl was stronger, the boy was weak, 
with her new mother she learned to speak. 
And wove a tale of a dying sun, they had left darkness, 
a dark world come undone. 
They travelled so far. Believing they came from a star. 
She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives. 
The men of science, the men of fame, the men of letters tried to explain: 
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time to make her 
think she'd fallen from the sky? 
A whirlwind spun them all alone, took them from their twilight home. 
Believing they came from a star.

In The Quiet Morning 
In the quiet morning
There was much despair
And in the hours that followed 
No one could repair
That poor girl 
Tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale 
Rolled in on a sea of disaster 
Rolled out on a mainline rail 
She once walked tight at my side 
I'm sure she walked by you 
Her striding steps could not deny 
Torment from a child who knew 
That in the quiet morning
There would be despair 
And in the hours that followed
No one could repair 
That poor girl 
She cried out her song so loud
It was heard the whole world round
A symphony of violence

Love Among The Ruins 
The sky was falling, heaven was calling. 
When danger crashes, rose from the ashes. 
Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock, 
we were praying for the secrets to unlock. 
And when the sun had turned its back on us, 
in the dark our love kept track of us, pushed together by the lack of love. 
We held each other tightly through our hell of dreams. 
I still hear the never-endig echo of those screams. 
But it's a life not made for reliving, it's a life that makes your soul forgiving. 
We sealed our bond from the beginning. 
Aching, affection, vulnerable protection; falling, captured, crawling, rapture.

There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night 
Who can say where they're blowing 
As free as the wind 
And hopefully learning 
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning 
More than this - there is nothing 
More than this - tell me one thing
More than this - there is nothing
It was fun for a while 
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night 
Who can say where we're going 
No care in the world

Has no way of turning

Rainy Day 
On bended knee I've looked through every window then. 
Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead; 
a day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found. 
Beneath a blinding light that would surround. 
We were without, in doubt, we were about saving for a rainy day. 
I crashed through floors of laughter, then. 
In a blind science, no ties would moor us to this room. 
A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found. 
And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.

In my darkest hour the only way to bring the dawn was your shining light.

Free me from my history and show me where to draw the line,

I'm not worried now about flying too close to the sun. 
When December skies are cold, you know I will always run to your shining light.

But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time
For who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me

You Won't Find Me There 
I'd like to know what makes you stay while your eyes still search for escape.
You think that I don't feel the cold, but I wait while confessions unfold. 
You'll never make a living from reading minds 
or from getting your direction from exit signs. 
Look into your heart and you won't find me there.
You won't find me where you hide and that makes us a matter of time. 
Like trees exposed by fall, time reveals it all. 
Tell me you want to do everything but you're stuck up to your knees.
And I'm less likely pushed forward by ambition than a breeze. 
But there's a flame that must be fanned, and it appears as a beckoning hand. 
Don't think 'cause you're not talking you're being kind, 
you've been getting your direction from exit signs. 
Look into your heart and you won't find me there.

April Weather 
Keep that head held high 
And dont you let them see you fall
Mistakes are blessings in disguise
Smile when everything falls
And laugh when you start to cry
Know Im here to wipe your eyes
You think that youre the only one
Who feels this way
Well kid, youve got a lot to learn
Everyone falls down too, you just never see it
What I see in you
Youre as cute as your smile
And as sweet as the rain
Yea
Dont listen when they say
You wont amount to anything
Cause I believe in you
I think that youre so pretty 
And I think that youre nothing short from amazing
I think that youre so perfect
So perfect to me
Youre as cute as your smile 
And as sweet as the rain

A Real Boy 
Am I holding back feelings that I show. I guess Im just scared to tell you what I know. Girl youve got me wrapped all around your words. So please speak up now, man if you only knew herwhen you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are. Anything your heart desires I will give to you. Is it just me or are you everything Ive dreamed?... I can read your eyes like a childhood book. And I become real and I know I should. Though my words are frail would you be mine tonight?

Breathe In 
So you take in everything you can
Just to make sure youre alright
And the voices from within
Begin to take flight
So you feel free, you feel everything
Just to feel alive
And youre dancing round and round
Just to feel this life
Now youre everything, everything right
But you dont feel alive
If your life is worth living, we all can try
To be alive
Amen
Time is of the essence, we cant learn to rhyme
But will millions of pages of all of lifes phrases, love, we can try
The voices around you, they claim to hold the truth, they cant save you
Just listen with eyes closed, feel what you know is life
Now I see the truth 
Its what binds me and you
And everyone swears that their real
Everyone swears they can feel
Well show me someone that loves this life

Brittany's Song 
-Verse 1-
Is this what you dreamed
That your life would always be
Torn up pages that never rhyme
Countless heartaches that always cry
-Chorus-
Do you want to come home
I know you try but you
Cant stand up strong
-Verse2-
I want you to know that 
I wont ever let you go
Try and try as you may
Ill be here every single day
-Bridge-
Youre an angel, Love, Ive told you that
So spread your wings and fly
Into the could where you belong
Now maybe the sun might shine

Carolee 
Ive seen the city, six times Im sure
Answered all the questions that you left on my door
Wrote all the answers on a Top Flight page
On the bed in my bedroom where I first thought you would soon amaze me
Well heres one question
For your diary filled with pages
What was the last thing I said?
Can you find the memory?
Or have you lost me
In pages beside your bed?
I find it strange that all you see
Is an open doorway, right before me and you walk on in
You said Please to meet you with that southern voice
So why cant I see that you leave me no choice?
Now listen dear
Speak words to me
Let me know that the place where youre at is halfway free
Cause here tonight
I fear youre lost

Dancing For Dreams 
Im not ashamed of
Anything that youve ever done
In fact I realize 
That its me youve been running from
The voices, the choices
Everything Ive done to keep you here
Is worthless, I know this
That letting go is your greatest fear
And you are safer
When I awake from my sleep
Im finally dancing for dreams
And now that you are free do 
Do you cry to sleep at night
I wont be there to wipe your eyes
To think I could stop time
Id do better to out shine the stars
Cause one day youll need me
But I wont be right there where you are
I wonder if its her
That keeps this fairy tale alive
Cause sometimes later at night
I feel the tear that comes from her eyes
I wont run away no I wont run away from you
Ill find a way, I will find a way to you

Go Down In A Fight 
Verse 1
Close your eyes, hold on tight
You're gonna make it
Rewind back to when you were young
Can you remember?
Trace back the innoncence that was lost
But can you find it?
-Chorus-
Go down swinging, go down in a fight
-Verse 2-
Tell me true, tell me that, that you love him
Honestly, does he let you understand
That you can make it
Just take my hand
-Repeat Chorus X3-
-Bridge-
And i'm not trying to write fairy tales
Cause girl you know their all lies
He says "you're great", that's wonderful
But can you see past his disguise...
-Verse 3-
You're an angel that's fallen from the stars
And they all want you...just look at your scars
-Chorus 2-
I swear you'll make, I swear you will
Give 'em hell kid, I'll be right there for you
It's alright, it'll be ok if you cry on my shoulder
Just let your tears fall on me
And realize, that all that glitters was never gold
It was your eyes
-Verse 4-
Now the crowd is wathin, watchin for you to fall
Give 'em hell kid, do it for us all
I told you once, i told you twice
Make a mistake and it'll cost a life...

Goodbye To New Orleans 
It almost kills me to realize that
I almost held you tight
You said New Orleans is where Im goin
And its just about time
Ill leave the faces, all the lonely places
Ill leave it all behind
I just shrug my shoulders, cause its gettin colder
In Mississippi tonight
No one understands what it feels like
To touch an angels hand
I hope your tears dont cry out the window
And dont look back, my love
They say everybody has somebody
They can grow old with
Well if thats true, then why is she leaving?
Why is she leaving rain clouds on my heart?
Im on my bed now, thinking about
You and everything I said
Dont leave me here
Dont say Goodbye
Cause youre in my heart
Where youll always stay
Where youll always stay, hey, hey
Come back to me
I am tired and I am broken
But Im willing to wait for you
Heres my last chance to let you know that
I love you and do you love me?
That summer was the greatest ever
I wished it never would have ended
When I looked at you and you looked at me
Just for once, Id like to know what it means to be free
You said New Orleans is where youre going
And its just about time
I never told you, but I will now
I think I love you

Her Wish 
-Verse 1-
She said I want someone to hold my hand
In the mall, just to make the other girls jealous
Someone to sing to me
And someone whos more romantic than goofy
Someone to throw stuffed animals at me
When Im acting dumb
And a guy who would make fun of me
Just to hear me laugh
-Chorus-
Well I cant buy you a diamond
Or a fancy life
But I could bet you all my kisses
Just to make you laugh
-Verse2-
She wants someone to play with her hair
And buy her a 25 cent ring
Someone who would share a lollipop
And count the stars just before it rains
Maybe someone who would fill their camera
Of pictures of her and their love
Someone who would always make her smile
That's someone she would love

My Greatest Fan(Jek Still Has It) 
-Verse 1-
Youre just above from amazing
Im a little short from anything
So would you take my hand
And lets run away
She likes the truth in any way
Even does dances when it rains
And she asked me Id like
To finish my life with her
-Chorus-
Well I would take you my friend
To a place far away
I know were in over our head
But you look so sweet, my greatest fan

Believe me, shes more than a song
She shines like Heaven when shes strong
Though lyrically, Im not a poet
And strangely Im ok
Cause you and I will outlive forever
Well give it a shot, someday

New York In The Winter 
You say dont worry, Ill be fine
Well the tears on your face tell me other wise
Its your unanswered questions that I cant explain
But Ill keep fighting for you
Instead of crying youd rather sing
Only the lighter notes of this symphony
So Ill protect you, I wont let you fall
And Ill keep fighting for you
So wont you take my hand tonight
And lets leave this town before it gets too late
Hey, I see city lights up ahead
New York has never been so bright
We were kids, what did we almost know?
That in the end wed follow through?
Your voice was strained from alcohol
Yet, I understood every word
You said hey boy, its not too late
For you to come and take me away
Matter of fact, Id rather leave right now
Cause Im tired of walking with the crowd
Its strange to see what youve become
When I think about leaving New York
Its a city of dreams that I always dreamed
That I could be a part of

Not Goin Back 
Tell me what you know and Ill spill my guts
About everything
Where were you when I felt like falling
Out in the rain?
Im not goin back
Again
Sometimes love I feel you with me
When its cold outside
You always loved the winter weather
You said itd never die
The leaves in the air matched the sky
I know because I was there
No one else could tell the wind
What it meant to you
Sometimes I wonder why
Why the snow fell down
It was questions wed figure out
Soon but not right now
I felt a pulling on my heart
But I told it to go
But it was you all along
You taught me what I know

Sing Me A Song 
Well maybe I try too hard for you
Yea, its just like me to do that
When common sense isnt the best choice
There needs to be one more voice
Day after day Im astounded
Of what you see in me
Beneath the skin-deep lies a hero
Waiting to come set you free
Here we are tonight
And it all seems right
From too many chances
How lost was I 
Fore you came in my life
I feel the best when we come alive
I stayed up late last night
Thinkin for once in my life
Are my words all but useless in time-consuming days?
Or do they just help me get by?
Everyone swears that Im crazy 
Well maybe Im crazy for you
When everything stays the same I change it
And Ill change it again
here it is shelby...haha. i heart you love!

Step Towards You 
When you come around
You make me feel so proud 
Isnt it common sense
When you feel like this
I would dance with you
Even if there was no song
We could get caught if we want
But playing games is just more fun
So I will
I will step towards you tonight
And I will
I will look into your eyes
Just to find out if theres life still left in this heart
Yea it beats but I just think that its not
Too many times have I failed to win
Just to prove I know where to begin
And you swear youre coming back around
She thinks that in the end
Shell become what shes not
And I cant help but laugh
Cause I know where she is and where Im at

Taylor's Song 
Hello dear friend I have been sitting here
Just bragging about your smile
And I have told many the memories that we shared
Its still hard to forget them
I smell your perfume when Im walking down the hall
I turn to hope its you
But I fail every time when I think that youre behind me
Cause youre always a step ahead
And I know its wrong but is it wrong to believe 
That theres still a chance for me
And I want to take your hand and make it mine once again
I still think youre the prettiest girl in the world
Signed me
In this crazy world theres only short romance
Lets make this last forever
Would you try to take back everything that you said
Cause it plays like a broken record in my head
Were better off friends, cause thats what well be in the end
Just friends?
O Nichole, you havent lost your touch, somehow Im still here
Just waiting for you
Now you just sit there lost in a stare
Please tell me one thing 
Have you forgotten that I was nothing till I saw your face
But now Im something, something youd be proud of
I feel some-what worth it and I know its cause of you

Thanks For A Good Time 
Im sorry for the day
That I saw your face
I tried to help myself, but I couldnt look away
Im sorry for the words
That I said to you
I couldnt help but tell you every word was true
I guess I got caught up
In what I thought could be
The greatest part of life, the greatest part of me
I wonder if you knew
What I was thinkin when 
You said to me that night Thanks for a good time
I guess I was just fooling myself
Cause how could I ever be with you
I guess my heart will rest here in last place
Its something Ive come used to
She cant help but feel
The lies that shes been told
Hell just run away, and youll grow only cold
I swear to you that I 
Will never leave your side
Ill always stand up tall

Theres no use fighting
Wed be denying what we know is true
Cause thats just what we do

The Love Of My Life 
Everyone has got something to show 
for me its this reflection 
promising itll find someone someday
and it seems like the whole world finally has sound 
telling me youre worth it 
and I think that youre worth it too my dear
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and I wont hold your hand 
cause Ill never want to let go 
its a test of will that I am willing to take 
As priceless as the voice inside your eyes 
I give all I have to
show that I am still here 
and I dream about meeting you someday 
when I do I swear to you I will 
hold you tight and never let you go
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and to the love of my life
heres my only prayer
that youll Christ more than you love this life
Cause thats where Ill find you
And I feel these chains finally broken
When I see your face staring right back at me
Its a chance that Ill take, yea I will
Just to show you that I really care
Girl I do, I swear that I care
And Ill stand back for now 
To admire you from afar
Just to show you that no one else has ever made me feel this way
And if you hold out your hand
Let it be to show me
That you were willing to wait till this day
To the love of my life
Youre my only prayer
Cause you loved Christ more than this life

When I See You(The Brandon Day Song) 
Theres no other way to say this
Love, Ive got to sing it
Gotta keep my head above the mountains
That Ive climbed to be with you
We were caught in something
I didnt let go
I told myself youd be back soon
I really hope I was right
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place
Honestly, I honestly
Knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
Knew that Id give everything I had
Just to see you smile
Tried to be perfect
Tried to let you let
Trying be as simple as the words
That come from my heart
You took me by surprise
When I first saw you
The sunlight in your hair
O, that long black hair in your face
I was nervous when you
Sat right down beside me
A firework display was nothing
Compared to your eyes that nite
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place
Honestly, I honestly
Knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
Knew that Id give everything I had
Just to see you smile
Tried to be perfect
Tried to let you let
Trying be as simple as the words
That come from my heart
And I would do it again
Just to relive those seconds
Even fireworks couldnt compare to you, my dear
Nor the stars that they shinned with
Its a memory
That I hope to see again
To see you smile one more time
To see your face shine like the stars
I knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
But it didnt matter, cause I was with you
And you were with me
You were so perfect
You were the one who let
This heart come back alive
With the way that I felt inside
I dont care if I am wrong
Dont care if I will fall
All that matters is that you could see
What you do to me
When I see you
When I see you

Who I Am 
You said you would dance around
If there was sound
You said you would paint my heart
Back into placeagain
I said you were everything
Anyone could ever dream
You said I was kindly blind
No one wants me
One look in your eyes and I was blinded
One touch of your hands and I was moved
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you
And the truth of it all is that you saved me
You asked me why tonight?
Why someone like me?
Ill tell you the same thing
I said to you that night
Its because for once in my life
I did something right
It felt like we stood there for hours
Just starin into the sky
But the true display was right beside
When I saw the work of God in your eyes
O yea
I saw that work of God in your eyes
And I was so astounded 
Cause you didnt even know
The air was filled with laughter, with love
And your eyes
One look in your eyes and I was blinded
One touch of your hands and I was moved
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you
And the truth of it all is that you loved me

Wishes 
-Verse 1-
Look inside the mirror and tell me what you see
Is it a lost or broken memory?
And I cant try to find a reason why
You find yourself in my arms tonight
Ive tried and tried until I fell down
The reasons why you cannot feel the ground
-Chorus-
Cause youre an angel, youre feel cant touch the ground
And the places that you lost were never found
Its an unknown reason I cant explain why
Cause I just make wishes when I look in your eyes
-Verse2-
Falling down is only halfway up
When youve fallen for the most beautiful girl
And she reads to me the stories of her life
When shes lying in my arms
She says Evan, why cant I hear the sounds

Go upstairs find some food
Come downstairs then i splooge
These are happy days of mine
The kind you'd like to find
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out
Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied
9 to 5 5 alive
5 to 9 9 is dead
Drain the pool whats the use
Eat a stool the lines are dead
Ask your friends to be kind
Ask the teacher when does it end
So pack your bags and your suitecase
Theres no more time you lost again
Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied
So now its the end of the day
Where your friends are untrue
And their letters are gay
Well i've got nothing to do
In a town thats shut down
Cause the heat when away
All the colours in the rainbow aren't enough for me
I want them all radio infrared and MTV
I've tried this one last time
My floor's a waste of time
So stop this stalling we're back to being boring
Clearly take my time (Take what was mine
We have never been satisfied what was mine
Clearly stear me blind what was mine
We will never be satisfied what was )
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out

I remember when you cried 
With your eyes on fire 
With the gale in your lungs, 
Screamed your throat red 
But now it's getting colder 
What happened to you? 
You're on your deathbed 
I remember when you laughed 
With the sunlight on your lips 
Sun rising high 
On your early morning smile 
But you're not waking up this time 
Breathless cries over lifeless eyes 
Your body is here, but you're not 
That thing that screamed with me 
And dreamed with me 
That thing that laughed with me 
And cried with me 
That same thing lies before me 
On this deathbed

Idefy 
Call it a lie 
Call it a crutch 
Call it denial 
Say it's an escape It's only the fear sought 
to beguile 
Say I've lost my tear 
Say I've lost my self doubt 
Say I've lost my life 
Say I've copped out. 
I defy you 
Soul is reality 
Regardless of what your beliefs may be 
Experiments? Proof? 
But are you brave enough to enter the laboratory? 
Transcendence perceived but will you open your eyes? 
A searcher, but are you willing to find? 
Or just remain content 
Wrapped tight in popular lies 
Say no one can know

No one no more 
I know I'm someone,

Crouched in a lonesome corner I shiver

My only cold companion

Will you suddenly, you where never alive (inside). When death closes your eyes. Wide, wide eyes of fear, I hear: death is howling near, what if I suddenly find, "success" was wasting my time? What if I suddenly find, I was never alive? When death closes your eyes. Is dust all that we live for? All that we know? Is dust all that we live for? Brace to face, embrace the void, how will aour loving lover comfort you? What will be the worth to all your winnings in this world, when ashes comes to dust? As this body must. When death closes your eyes. Abandon the death-life, re-ignite the light inside

He wants to be your reservoir of pleasure 
And wants to be your heart's only treasure 
Your everything, your only-thing 
Your god, he wants to be your god 
How far you fall for it  how far you fall 
He's the only he

Sex turns you (us) to stone and that's reality

Friday Morning 
Thrown into the light / Taught how to believe / Learn to love / Learn to hate / Then learn to read the lines between / We've looked at our past mistakes / And learned that time can heal your wounds / Stand tall with pride at any stake / But the reminder of a scar will stay too soon / The victory of life / The forfeit chose in death / The goals we all chase / Closer with our every breath / Arms wide open now / Waiting for that sweet embrace / The tears we hold back / For fear of one's disgrace...
Somewhere off in candyland theres an answer to our prayers / Theres a reason for the suffering / Our expression's in the air / The story moves along / Human saga must go on / Don't sleep / Don't dream / Don't even look outside
Thrown into a world / Taught how to conform / Learn to breathe / Learn to see / Then learn to join the swarm / We've marched up to the edge / Together we could take it all / We stare down at that ledge / And contemplate the fall / The ecstasy of life / The mystery of death / The doom that haunts us all / Closer with our every breath / Eyes wide open now / Just too good to waste / Everything we know / Is only our first taste...

Horizons 
Here we are again, standing alone on the brink of emptiness / Prepare for one more goodbye, as the stars begin to dot the sky...
Will you become that stranger alone? / The stars and stripes that mock you flying high above your home... / What will it be like the next time I see you? / Will you ever change your self centered world view?
Where are we going? / And I don't know where we will stay / A handshake and smile, and no kiss goodbye / And we'll each be on our way
Please look after everything while I'm gone / When I'm not back tomorrow carry on / The juggernaut of time works itself in tricky ways / The dancing lessons of bokonon define the path we take...
Why have we come here? / Has our mission been acomplished yet? / A formal goodbye, with no questions why / As we continue on our quest
Somewhere in the distance, the future tells our tale / The ships that we have built ourselves have already set sail / Someday things might make sense, its not just bullshit / An answer, a reason... someday we'll find it! / Stories have passed, I'll keep ours in mind / Lost in the fray however frozen in time / I looked into the future

Although I may not know what the future has in store / I hope it's not all as corrupt as the house next door
The new neighbours are moving in, first doing some construction / With the help of low wager mexican day laborers / They brag to us like it's joke, pretend to be decent folk / Human rights are second best, we honor most our own best dressed / They're moving in any day now, things have changed we see and how / Our greed and pride lead us in, overlooking our own sins

A call to arms nobody hears / Our efforts fallen on deaf ears / And though our goals seem palpable / Attaining them seems unclear / Though no one will tell you you're wrong / As the dollar sign strings us along / Its time to evaluate / The reasons we belong / But when our freedom takes away theirs / It does not ring out everywhere / As we exercise our right to take / Everything thing that's there
As the corporations we support, quickly take over the earth / We take more than we need, while others go hungry! / Keep the third world on their knees, down subservient to us / There's nothing we can do! that's not fucking true!
But if we cant break the walls they build / We still can change our lifestyles / If we cant break the walls they build / We still can change our lifestyles
My life wont be sold, chasing down the dollar sign / Wear a corporate soul, to replace the one you sold / To prosper at the sake of others is not why I'm alive / We take more than we need, to justify our greed!
No motives unclear, prosperity driven / Our revolution, must come from within / If I never give up and you never give in / We can change the world we live in!

When you look back on the best night of your life will you remember the things you were wearing? / The car you arrived in? / The beer you were drinking? / No you'll consider the friends you were with and the experience itself
So I say throw it all in the fire / Gain control by letting go / Forget what you want / Live at peace with your home, evolve!
When you look back on what you've accomplished don't you hope to have gained something more than material? / A two week vacation? / A story with no moral? / I'd rather look back and believe I'd made a difference / Maybe not to you, maybe nobody's listening
We still haven't found our way...
So I say throw it all in the fire / Gain control by letting go / Forget what you want / Live at peace with your home, evolve!
Just hoping I might change somebody's mind, first I'll openly admit it's the blind leading the blind / Just hoping I might change somebody's mind, first I'll openly admit it's the blind leading the blind / That's why I'm still standing here! / Thats why I'm still waiting!

Who are we to stand here in the way of "progress"? / How foolishly hubristic we are... / To think that we might almost start to make a difference / Stand in the way and flail our arms...
You can talk about the things that make you more upright than me / You can say that nothing matters...but everything matters too much for your apathy
Who are you to question our morality? / Like any of us want to hear your outcry... / Your superficial thoughts lost in the massive ocean / We can't change that but we try...
Scattered and few, beaten and bruised - our disbanded union / Lost and confused, time falling through, I promised I'd be here / Where the fuck are you?
Mr. nowhere is from the wrong side of the tracks / He earns less than me because he's black / As hard as it may be to fess up to this truth / Xenophobic ideas infiltrate our youth, and / When we're older will we think that it's alright? / Will our children inherit the fight left hanging? / I won't give up or give in I hope to say / That my commitment will remain...
Man destroys earth, man destroys man, reality's a trip I can't understand / I saw a vision oh-so wrong, it was the world I know except I was gone / All too real, and all too strange, never existed, I was a silent name / Saw my dad, and saw my mom, everyone just carried on... / No one knows exactly where this shit began / So this is simply where I stand... / And this is just where I stand / (Still dreaming, still screaming

The Decay Of Modern Man 
Eyes opened to a world of flashing lights / Of sleepless nights... in apartments / Playing and telling a sorry tale to a drunken crowd / He can't afford the rent / A book of matches, a cigarette, and a forgotten art / Describes the job, yet his drinks come free of charge / And with each gulp his blurred vision clears...
Putting depressions into lasting impressions / He sees everything and nothing all at once in a windowless vision / Full of liquor and pipe dreams...
His world is found hidden underneath the American Dream / Which peels away revealing scabs that fester and bleed / He can do nothing but provide the soundtrack to lifes more melancholy moments / He dislikes individuality and therefore owns similar suits in which to dress / 99 black and 1 blue, bought in his fleeting moment of weakness...
A gaze into his eyes / Reveals white on white... Emptiness, Emptiness / And yet the wrinkles on his brow depicts the decay of modern man / That's what he's searching for? / To be the modern man? To be the common man?

The Last Fish 
Upon one foggy afternoon, a foolish man ran out of room / In his garbage can so he, threw his trash into the sea / He did this time and time again, the sea still looked fine to him / He saw no reason to stop this, until the day he met a fish... / The fish told him you're a fool, who will clean up after you? / Don't throw your garbage near me, we don't want it in the sea / But the fish was never heard, 
&
 instead the mean just spread the word / Before long everybody disposed of their rubbish in the sea... / That's where it all fell apart! / The water's color slowly changed, and the sea was quickly drained / Of the life that had lived there, it was now almost completely bare / The man returned, one rainy day, but not to throw garbage away / He planned to catch some fish instead, not knowing they were mostly dead / The man fished all day and night, but simply nothing would bite / Caught some boots and metal chains, but threw them back to where they came... / When the sun came up the next day, the man give in when he began to pray

Wheel Goes Nowhere 
Every time I look into this board of abstract numbers I pretend to see things that simply are not there / Surrounded by others in my same position trying to give some value to their cold blank stare / I wonder whats the point of useless education as we stress out learning someone elses' number games / Running like hamsters 'cuz this wheel goes nowhere and every time the outcome's just the same
There is no free thought when (Education?) / Our minds are bound in chains (I think not!) / Was this system designed to stunt our minds / Or just conveniently work out this way?
I'd like to think there is more to our lives than just math and science twice a week phys. ed / And I'd like to think that I see through the system but consumerism permeated my head / We try so hard, we bite our nails to make a million dollars and fill our role / Why fight the norm and a million before us and be at the disadvantage of the others... who've already sold their souls?
One future no choices, One future no changes / A hush to our voices, now silent, now painless / And as the sun sets on our dying rebellion / That trigger not fired, our revolution expired

24 Hours 
Here on the street
Feeling the cool of the dawn
Shuffling feet
Faces are ragged and worn
They've been working all night
Waiting for the curtain to rise
While you're under the sheets
You with the stars in your eyes 
Letter box noise
Snapping the day into life
Newspaper boys
Cutting the mist like a knife
We're beginning to rise
Curtain up the drama begins
It's the start of the race
All of us wanting to win 
People rushing shouting pushing
Got no time for conversation
Inner city population
The struggle for communication
People trying pressure rising
Hook and hustle flex your muscle
It's all part of living
Do you wanna get away 
Restaurant smells
Mix in the heat of the day
Telephone bells
Kissogram girls on her way
Someone's thinking of you
Birthday boy is in for a treat
And the message is clear
Once a year life can be sweet 
Caught in a flash
Cover girl freezes her smile
Media trash
Blinding the crowd with such style
It's a dazzling affair
A fantasy to star in your dreams
Do you want to believe
Everyone knows what they've seen 
Twilight time in the city
And the shutters are down
That's when the singles are lost in their doubles
The happy hour comes round
To help you unwind in the shadows
Takes the tension away
It's been a hell of a day in the city
Now it's your time to play 
Living under pressure
Do you wanna buy a dream? 
I say Phil can you get it he say
Alright alright alright
Tell me when can I get it he say
Tonight tonight tonight
I want money on delivery hey
That's right that's right that's right
I say baby don't you trust me he say
The city's a jungle where the strongest survive 
Neonic heat
Flooding the darkness with light
The capitol beats
Feeding the pulse of the night
It's the music of life
Listen to the sound of the crowd
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so loud 
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so....

He's moving into action man
He's looking good but maybe
He's in the wrong direction man 
But he wanna get a little, get a little
Every night, get a little, get a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs to have a recreation
Everybody needs a little comfort for the soul 
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in 'em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you 
He's cruising with the singles
Down the margarita bar
He's boring to distraction
Pushing words and talking stars
(What's your sign) 
He's gotta take a little, take a little
On the side, make a little, make a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs a little lubrication
Someone with imagination got to break the ice 
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit 
You can't be a lover without rhythm
Don't blow your horn if you ain't true
No point in playing Valentino

Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue

Age Of Consent 
I want to meet you at that restaurant
The one you love it's got a pretty front
What a front
The girls are holding hands
It's a treat to indulge
Or we can sit awhile and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
You don't have to be coy
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything that the traffic allows  
We touch each other then we sip the wine
We smile and nod together, this is fine, it's so fine
Come on in the water's fine
We can jump right in
Or we can look around and bide our time
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything 
I'm not holding you back Heaven's sake
Have you got to jump out of the cake
I don't want your endeavours to fail
But that pouch has got a sting in the tail
Sting in the tail 
This little place has got me in a trance
We're getting closer but it's just a dance, just a dance
The band won't make a sound
We can warm it up
Or we can hold it back and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything can be yours, but don't shout....

Americana Panorama 
Martin Luther B.B. King
You had a dream and you make us swing
Doctor Winston J.F.K.
You had a dream but they blew you away 
Americana panorama
Big apple rice banana
Bit but keep your backs against the wall 
Pretzel logic does apply
Oh fast food junk food gets you by
You got delis diners southern fries
And burgen queens with hungry eyes 
That's Americana panorama
Aerobatic instant karma
Run but do your jogging in the car 
Tricky didn't make it
But his part deserves an oscar
When he proved that you can fool the people
all the time
And from the Rockies to the Hudson
Everybody loves a winner
Turn a blind eye to corruption
While the nation grows
Oh oh I feel the pressure rising
You're on top of the world but it's about to blow
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you know? 
Take a look at what you've done
You are the shape of things to come
It's science fiction coming true
You can shoot the stars it's up to you 
Americana panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true
Oh oh Americana panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true

Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin' make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven 
Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays

Baron Samedi 
I'll show you man who walk on fire
And don't get burned
Don't get burned, don't get burned
He don't get burned
I'll show you man who tread on glass
And he don't get cut
Don't get cut, don't get cut
He don't get cut 
You can take a knife and slit his throat
And he won't drop dead
Won't drop dead, won't drop dead
He won't drop dead
Been a ju-ju boy for a thousand years
And he ain't cut yet
Ain't cut yet, ain't cut yet
He ain't cut yet 
Hold 'em
You've got to crease 'em and fold 'em
You've got to shape 'em and mould 'em
Take a piece of their soul man 
Well he can take a little moonlight
Suck the poison from a snakebite
Movin' round about midnight
He's got the power of life 
See the sacrifice of the virgin women
See the deadly snake and the headless chicken
Take a sip from dripping red
Make it with the living dead 
Take you up when you feeling down
When you're sick he will come around
Takes his cures from out the ground
He's the one who can hypnotize
And you'll never believe your eyes
He can cause the dead to rise

Bee In My Bonnet 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder
I got a hole in my shoe
And my toes are getting colder
I got ants in my pants
I got fries in my thighs
I got a bone in my nose
I got frit in my ass 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder 
I got a flee in my ear
I wear my heart on my sleeve
I got a ticket for the train
And I'm ready to leave
I got a rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie woogie flu
I got the palpations
All because of you 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder 
I'm burning, with love 
I got my fish on the line
I got my hand in the water
I know right from wrong
So I do what I oughta 
I laugh in the day
I cry in the night
Woo hoo baby
Gonna be alright 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder

She doesn't need money
She doesn't need diamonds
She's lookin' for pretty things
She doesn't want romance
She doesn't need finance
She's looking for rendezvous
But every time she's going down
She never looks around
I'll wait and watch her with my
lens until she brings the curtain down
'There behind the keyhole'
with my fisheye
I'm back in the darkroom
I'm covered in fixer
I'm making a photograph
I'll send her some postcards
In glorious colour
I'm keeping the negatives
I'll form a letter from the news
With different type from different lines
I'll tell the world about her
I'll mail the People and the Times
'Oo it'll be so scandalous
For the both of them
But mainly her'
She showed them her husband
He ordered a dozen
He thought they were fabulous
The one with the --
The two of the --
And three of the --
He sold her to Hefner
Who put her in Playboy
He gave her a centre-fold
I made a real blunder
She made it in movies

Bluebird 
Bluebird take me on your wing
Teach me how to fly
Teach me how to sing
Bluebird, guardian of my soul
Inside everybody
Is a story to be told 
I came in from the cold
When I found someone
Strong enough to bear
The strain of our existence
And troubles everywhere
But time heals
And I know you'll be there... ooh  
Bluebird symphony in flight
Symbol of the dawn
Symbol of the night
I'll try with all my might to be a brother
Always there for you
Mother (mother, mother) knowing what to do 
And farther than anyone has flown
Courage to spread your wings alone
And who will help me?
Bluebird 
Bluebird stranger to these shores
I look into your eyes
Have you been here before 
Take me through the door to Heaven
And show me
The treasures that you keep
The magic of the sky
And the beauty of the deep 
And I'll do what I have to do
To be one of the chosen few
Fly anywhere with...
You, Bluebird 
Bluebird, Bluebird (Yeh)

Brand New Day 
When you open your eyes
To a brand new morning
And the sun shines 
Above you
You pull on your breeches and say
Oh well,
It's the start of a brand new day 
For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below, your body must go
Against the grain
Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the 
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy
'Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere'
But there below your body must go 
For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below your body must go
Against the grain
Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the 
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy,
'Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere'
But there below your body will go 
At the end of the day
When you look around you
And the sun sets
Deep inside you 
Dust off your breeches and say
'Oh well'
Say goodnight to the man in the moon
The sandman's on his way

Channel Swimmer 
Well it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me 
I've greased my body
and I'm heading over the ocean
These two arms are the only locomotion
I need 
See me swim and see me float
I don't need no motorboat
or a yacht to get me there 
I'll do the breaststroke
and the backstroke
I'll do anything
I'll be swimming when you're all asleep
I'll be swimming when you're all awake
I'll do the sidestroke
the other sidestroke
I'll do the butterfly
But I ain't gonna crawl
on back to you, no way 
I see your face in every breaker
I see your smile across the reef
I came across the sea to take you
Don't make me out to be a thief 
You'll be dreaming when you're all asleep
But I'll be drowning when you're all awake
I did the breaststroke
I did my best stroke
I did everything
But I ain't good enough 
'Cause it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me...

Charity Begins At Home 
a shake of the tin
the money drops in, but is it a sin
you're standing in rags
you're selling your flags
but who gets the dough at the end of the day
we saw your drop-dead fancy wheels
your little house up on the hill
but when your conscience pricks
a little sacrifice sweetens the pill 
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
we take to the stage
the audience rave, we're doing our bit
a heavenly cast, a blast from the past
there's a song to be sung, will it make number one
we wanna see your money roll
but our eyes are on the hall of fame
'cos business is business
and hits are the name of the game 
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away
no don't turn away 
your doors are locked
you switch on the box to take in a show
you think that you're safe
but here comes that face
and wouldn't you know it's that message again
they want to take your plastic cash
your hand reaches out to the phone
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home 
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away

But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight

Pull on your boots brand new suit

And a shot of midnight fever

Get on the beat shuffle your feet
Never know you might get lucky

Flashing like a neon
Feed 'em a line

Going out of my mind

Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb

Advertising that our time is running

Oh with just one minute to live
Oh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again
'Cos what goes up must come
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down 
Oh, the gravity of the situation
It's only my willpower
That keeps this thing in operation
But we're gonna crash that's for certain
The pilot is too busy flirtin'
And he ain't aware
That there's a bomb down there
And if he don't do something it's curtains 
"Now just hold on,"
Said the little bomb,
"If you were just to hold my hands
Then time would stop
The plot would flop
And jumbo would be safe to land" 
Tick a tick a time bomb

From Chattanooga to Japan
I taxi through the airways -
What a swell little plane
What a fine little plane
What a great little plane

I'm a clockwork wreck
And though my fuse is burning slow
Must keep my date to detonate
Goodbye, ta ta, and cheerio

Code Of Silence 
Deep in the night
I can hear you calling my name
How can I try to help you woman
If you go on hiding your pain
Baby, Baby, the tears on your pillow are real
You can't go on pretending to me
when I see the pain that you feel 
A code of silence, is a dreadful thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game) 
Lost in your dreams
Trouble on your face in the pale moonlight
Nowhere to run you've got to let me know
Where you are standing tonight
Baby Baby Baby
I know that you're hurting inside
Open your heart
I know that we can make it
If you talk to me now 
A code of silence, is a deadly thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)

when something crazy takes me far away
we must stick together through this madness
i've got so many things I want to say 
too many forces try to come between us
so little time to share and talk to you
if i show my hand to you in panic
please remember what i'm going through

i didn't want it this way
don't think i don't trust in you

before the world we knew was torn apart
now when i close my eyes i can be with you
but are we really dancing in the dark 
a bad connection leads us to confusion

Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in 
I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you 
I'm doing really well

I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me 
When I'm walking in the dark

And I got loady do di dodied
Lousy violins began to play
I went no no no
And as the vol-au-vents exploded
I was walking down the aisle the other way 
Don't hang up

Don't say, Oooh
Nobody's safe in our house 
Leave me alone
But a but a please
Leave me alone
Just a mo, a minute
I'm so alone

Some honeymoon on itchy bedding
Scum buzzing round your busy body
Dumb waiters waiting sweating straining
All mass-debating my woman 
We got a

Crumbling about our ears, Ole

You got a dustbin romance
It's going down the drain 
You got a low impedence
She's got a rocky terrain 
Oo, you got a lot to learn
Oo, you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn about women
A lot to learn about women women
What's to learn about women
We've both got a lot to learn 
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
Have we won the no Nobel Prize
Has the colour run out of our dies 
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes 
When the barman said "What're you drinking?"

If you want love to stay
Don't give all your secrets away
It's not the fashion
But hold back your passion 
Don't - open your heart, no

Give her some time and 
Don't - drive her away, no

Feed in the hunger 
Hold back your passion 
You're not an open book

Under the cover
Let her discover 
Don't - stop the surprising, no
Don't - take all the mystery out of it, no

Kill her desire

Dreadlock Holiday 
I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other 
I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
Don't you walk thru my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet 
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be jokin' man
It was a present from me Mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home 
And I say
I don't like reggae no no
I love it
I don't like reggae oh no
I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer on me pitch
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet 
I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' pina coladas
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder
She said I've got it you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it you'll like it
And wallow in a Dreadlock Holiday 
And I say
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her oh yea
Don't you walk thru her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet

Dressed To Kill 
Put your money where your mouth is
Get your finger on the buzzer
Paint it on
Show the bumps
Cos you're really gonna jump tonight
Can you fell you're getting ready?
Don't you see it in the mirror?
Show it all
Show too much
Hey, you're really gonna jump tonight 
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough  
Put your image in your pocket
Hang your collar in the closet
Cause a crash
Make a splash
Cos you're really gonna wipe 'em out
Getting rid of inhibitions
Makes a little exhibition
Turn it on
Lossen up
Cos you're really gonna wipe 'em out 
Dressed to kill, she wanna play with you
Watch your step, she's gonna run you through
Dressed to kill, she's got amazing grace
Watch the Devil, with an angel's face
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough 
So you're lookin' like a million
And you're getting the attention
Play 'em up
Turn 'em on
Boy they're really gonna work tonight
Hey he's sittin' in the corner
Like a little Jack Horner
Make him break
Take his cake
Oh he's gonna be your fool tonight
Catch him with that funky stuff
Take him till you've had enough

Everything Is Not Enough 
It doesn't help you if you scream and shout
That isn't what this thing is all about
And do you really want to fight to win
You're missing out and that's another sin
Your dream of power is a sacrifice
Do you really want to pay that price
Just think about it and you'll change the pace
Look in the mirror tell me who do you face
Who is that? 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop  
Nobody loves you if you moan all day
So take it easy then you'll get your way
You ain't no dummy and I'm sure you know
You know it's better if you let it go
You're in control if you let it go
You're feeling better when you let it flow
You never really had to catch the moon
You're better jumping to another tune
So let's jump 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop (do, do, do it) 
I've got it all but it's not enough
I keep thinking "Boy I feel so rough
This can't be me, I'm such a happy guy"
I laugh a lot but I want to cry
A cry for help is just letting go
It hurts a lot but I think I know
It's time for change I don't need the hype
It's time for change and the time is ripe
So let's go 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop...

Everything You Wanted To Know About!!!! (Exclamation Marks) 
I took my fantasy to Deborah
You know she's always been a friendly girl
You'll see her cruise the Picadilly streets
And she winks at every man she meets
I've been a fan of hers for quite a time
I tried to pull her with a bummer line
I asked her would she like a cigarette
And she said let's go to bed
('cause that's what you want) 
And so I went
And I was shocked
I was so green
Ground I wish you'd swallow me up
She had to laugh
I nearly died
Some Superstud!
There's more to this than meets the eye 
I hurried back to read the manual through
You know the one that tells you what to do
But all I needed was the confidence
To start and break the ice
Experience would be a boon for life
And Debbie smiled as I came strolling by
I said I'd like to have a second shot
And I'd give it all I've got 
And with a twinkle in her eye
She led me by the hand
Through a door to a room
Above a Soho restaurant
And she smiled and told me
Not to look so serious
But by the time she'd talked me down
I was delerious, I was away 
I had to window shop in Amsterdam
But down the Troubador in Hollywood
I found a lover who was bold enough
To live my fantasy (this isn't a dream) 
I was away
Up in the blue
Emmanuelle
How you gonna make it in a jet
The need to shock
Was coming through
Where would it end
You'll never know

Feel The Benefit 
[REMINISCE AND SPECULATION]
You went out on the street without your shoes on
You didn't listen what your momma said
She said you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
And if we all went out without our shoes on
Tell me where would we be, where would we be 
If all the people in the world lost their reason
What would we see, where would we be
If all the entertainers in the world lost their music
What would they play, what could they say
To pacify the crowd, to justify themselves
Won't feel the benefit 
You're like a cloud behind the sun
Like the face behind the clown
You're moving like the wrinkles in a frown
And you can never look back
A leaf that's borne upon the wind
A cardboard suitcase in your hand
The wanderer soon returns
And finds the colour of the grass is just the same
On the other side of the tracks, oh no 
["A" LATIN BREAK]
Ooh when you smile it's like a holiday
Ooh pack your bags and we can get away
We'll float on a Queen down to Rio
There's no need to shave
We'll be stinking like rum in a punch 
You can walk on the water
You can dabble in the mumbo jumbo
You can smoke a little ganja
Float like a cloud over Rio, Rio
You can ride with the Gauchos
Swinging your bolas in a red bandana
You can run with the devil
Takin' your chances with Senorita 
You can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil
But the bill is gonna make you ill 
FEEL THE BENEFIT 
So, you can go out on the street and take your chances
But if you do, you better do it right
Or you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
Spin the wheel and take your chances
And your number might come up
Though the odds may be in favor of the house 
If all the people in the world would say together
We're all black and white, we're all day and night
If all the people in the world could sing together
How would it sound, what would we feel 
We'd all feel the benefit

Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma) 
I saw you so pretty
Your face lit up the city
Two worlds came together
The memory stays for evermore 
So different your fashion
You were the main attraction
Heads turning in wonder
I felt myself go under
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand 
[CHORUS]
Nothing can stop you when you
Feel the love
No chains can hold you when you
Feel the love
Don't try to fight it when you
Feel the love
Nobody matters but the one you love 
My intro I fumble
My facade starts to crumble
So strange your reaction
I made the right connection now 
You got me no bother
I can't see any other
The world keeps on turning
I wouldn't care if it was burning
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand 
[CHORUS]
It's a million to one
You should find the right door
But there's no guarantee
You'll find what you're looking for
Don't give up if you blow it the first time around
But you've got to beware
If you're walking on air
Keep your feet on the ground
(Keep your feet on the ground) 
Don't stop me I'm not dreaming
I can't ignore this feeling
Your love is my lifeline
You're so right so fine so glad you're mine
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand

Fill Her Up 
my baby told me she would meet me on the street
stood behind a lamppost, I could only see her feet
now I'm not one to grumble, don't want to be a bore
but that silly bitch Jane Fonda's got a lot to answer for
told the women of the world that the only way to win
work out 'til you burn out and you'll get super slim
i rushed her to the restaurant and called the maitre d', oh help me 
fill her up, fill her up
load up, load up
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep it coming, keep it coming
never let it stop 
we staggered from the restaurant feeling in the pink
i slipped into the liquor store and gave the man a wink
my baby got the shivers, said you've got to stop and think
what you're doing to your body with this evil demon drink
said the poison that you're buying gonna eat away your brain
i said you'd better listen up before you go insane
knocked her off her soapbox, rushed her to the bar, and shouted 
fill her up, fill her up
down 'em, drown 'em
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep 'em coming, keep 'em coming
never let them stop 
that's right, one more
tequilla sunrise with a little umbrella on it
okay, encore
a bloody mary with a little shot of bourbon on the side 
too many moaning minnies
they're out to spoil our fun
watch out for sister anna
she's the one who bangs the drum
bang the drum 
now you may think i'm worried by the screwballs that i meet
just to prove i'm not i'll throw a party in the street
everyone's invited, but you've got to take the pledge
leave behind your scruples, let me take you to the edge
everything in moderation that's the golden rule
take away all pleasure, that seems kind of cruel
to give the people power got to give them fuel, so i say 
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 
fill her up, fill her up...

For You And I 
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
and we put 'em down 
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin' 
She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
Don't pass her by
The world of wisdom behind her eyes
Could answer everything
But you and I 
We seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)
We never look around
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
and we put 'em down 
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin' 
She's not beautiful
But don't make it plain
You underestimate
It's not a game
A heart of gold
Behind the drab
Would comfort anyone
But you and I 
Should try to see it from the other side (oooh)
We'll get a shock
It could surprise you 
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
take a look around
We set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)
never make a sound 
The rain must fall
But we can change
Our understanding
will remain
So take a moment
To wonder why
The world keeps turning

Fresh Air For My Mama 
So say one and so say all
Say what you gotta say
Or don't say nothing at all
You been tossin' and turnin' through soft sticky nights
While the Bronx below you fights to stay alive 
So say one and so say all
Be what you gotta be
Or don't be nothing at all 
Be gracious to your mother
When you leave this neighbourhood
The change is going to do her good
Next to me you look bad
'Cos there ain't no fresh air for my momma, my momma 
But the drop is shear
When you break away 
Take me away
It's just about time to hit the road
And say
You gotta believe in something
It's easy to see
My God is fading away
So pick up your bible and pray for me 
We're all alone in the darkness
But our eyes are wide open
We don't see nothing
And our hands are tied
To the railings of the Bowery
And the humid city slickers
So say one and so say all
We had a lot to say
And we said it all 
The cost of living in dreams
Is rising like a crime wave
The American way of dying 
And it gets you every time
And it looks like it's got to my momma
My momma
May she rest in peace

Head Room 
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cos it's far too wet to woo 
When Mummy and Daddy play
They tell me to go away
But by hanging around
I can learn all the rules
Now I got the technique
I'm away 
Develop a taste for it
A time and a place for it 
Although on the face of it, it's a crime
I've nibbled the cheese of it
The birds and the bees of it
Are weak at the knees
From making honey
Every time 
I'm throwing my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the boys
Gimme girls
And it's time I was breaking away 
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some leg room
Just a little bitta leg room
I see myself Oh Lord
I see a mess 
I'm making a meal of it
I'm breaking the seal of it
I'm getting the feel of what to do
It's got a good ring to it
I'm getting a thing for it
And if there's a sting in it
I'll have met my Waterloo
My Mummy and Daddy said
You're liable to wind up dead 
Oo, they've been shooting me a line
Maybe it doesn't exist at all
Oo, I've been towing the line
Now I'm hook line and sinkered 
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cos it's far too wet to woo 
I've thrown all my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the girls that you get
For a dollar a day
When you pull on their strings they say 
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need a ball room
Up against the wall room
I need the rest Oh Lord

Oh, it's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine 
At night we, sleep tight we
Stay close together 'cos the temperature's down
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around 
Please don't touch her 
Sittin' with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto, be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride 
My baby, goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
She's bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display 
So, don't get too close
Oh she's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine 
Ooh it's a drag when you're hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang think she's part of the scenery
You're never alone and the tension is painful to see 
One night I, crept in and,
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life 
Now we'd like to....

Hotel 
On de uber side ob de island
Dere's a sky so clear and blue
Can see, cross water, to de mainland
New life for me and you 
Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut 
Well there's a big black mama
In a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell
From tree to tree 
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go 
We get American menus
With all American men
We're getting sick of things American
We ate our way through half the Pentagon
We had our share of big palookas 
Yankee go home

Hot To Trot 
She had a shake like a belly dancer
and a body like a tiger tiger (uh huh, uh huh)
She was looking at me 
Now you know that I ain't no dancer
But there's gotta be a way to meet her
So I just walked up to her and said
Are you hot to trot? 
Well I knew I was looking cool
Pretty sharp like a razor razor (uh huh, uh huh)
She was smiling at me 
So I said if you got the notion
We could take a little trip to the ocean
She said that'll be OK
'Cause I'm hot to trot 
We were having a ball by the water
Talking about life and philosophizing (uh huh, uh huh)
She was really talking to me 
She said I can't understand why you gotta hustle
Struttin' and posin' and flexin' muscle
So I said, well that's easy baby
I'm hot to trot

How'm I Ever Gonna Say Goodbye 
I've been thinkin' writin' you a letter
Maybe telegram would be better
I'll be worried how it's gonna get there
So I go and change my mind  
Need a little time to chew it over
But every day I grow a little older
Got de devil sittin' on me shoulder
Gonna make me change my mind 
Got me drinkin' even got me smokin'
Got me sinkin' nearly got me chokin'
What'll you do in the morning
What'll you do in the morning
When I'm gone 
Thought I'd better have me a vacation
Got my ticket made my reservation
Want my name address and occupation
So I go and change my mind

How'm I ever gonna go to sleep at night
How'm I ever gonna close my eyes

You'd better not annoy me or I'll do 
Somethin' that you won't forget in a hurry
And I might be back for some sloppy seconds 
You've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone
My word they say that I'm belongin'
In a home for crazy people
But you know I don't belong there

I Hate To Eat Alone 
I picked myself up in a downtown bar
You know the feelin' was lousy
But as I'd come this far
Well it's too easy to drink
When nobody's home
But I hate to eat alone 
'N' frozen dinners don't do much for me
When you've got T.V. on the table
'N' T.V. on T.V.
All you do is chew your fingers
Down to the bone
I hate to eat alone  
Like the actor who's forgotten his words
You stumble through the story line
Another place another time
When you were with me 
They say the city's rotten to the core
There's no communication with each other anymore
But we stopped talkin' to each other a long time before
And I hate to eat alone 
Hear it in my words
See it in my eyes
Since you went away
I wear a cheap disguise
Waitin' for the mornin'
Waitin' on the light
Hopin' for the sunshine
Before the night 
I didn't tell you that I had to change
So you just took it for granted
That we'd remain the same
I know that nobody's guilty
No one's to blame so I end up on my own
God I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone

I'm Mandy Fly Me 
Just like a rollin' stone
I'm outside lookin' in 
But if your chance came would you take it
Where on earth do I begin
I'm Mandy fly me 
I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard
She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
But I'm hiding in the small print 
Won't you take another look
And take me away
Try me Mandy fly me away
The world was spinning like a ball
And then it wasn't there at all
And as my heart began to fall 
I saw her walking on the water
As the sharks were comin' for me
I felt Mandy pull me up give me the kiss of life 
Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No 
Ah when they pulled me from the wreckage
And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no 
I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone said Hi
I'm Mandy fly me

I'm So Laid Back, I'm Laid Out 
The people were running
The place was on fire
The smoke was a-growing
And the flames were getting higher 
The fire chief was shouting
As he knocked down my door
He said you better move your butt boy
Or you'll knock on heaven's door 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 
The rent needing paying
The insurance was due
The roof needing fixing
And the rain was coming through 
But the forecast is sunny
So I'll stay here on my back
Tomorrow is another day
It's cozy in the sack 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 
There were times when you wanted to be number one
And the glamour and the glitter were turning him on
But he realized that it was better to be number two (ooh)
My luxury is living
'Cause I can't afford to die
I'm a diletantic mother
With a twinkle in my eye 
Let the others do the running
I'm content to take a cut
Percentages are burning
And I'm happy in my rut 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more

To a dream
Hoping that time
Would turn your fear away
But you must stop
Take a look around

They've got no business to talk

Where reason is a waste of time
Nobody talking

Touching you deeply
Way down inside you
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved

When it feels so right
But I must find out
Take a look around me
What do I feel
What'll I do 
You see I've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping you'll find
The love you need in me
Giving you time
To make your mind up
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved 
People say that I'm crazy

I Took You Home 
I looked at your face somehow I knew
Nothing could tear me away
You started to smile and I was lost
Fumbling for something to say
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know 
The windows were frosty and grey
But we didn't notice the cold
Wrapped in the warmth of your body
Hoping this dream would never go
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know  
Your folks were sleeping soundly upstairs
We couldn't really turn on the light
So I stumbled and we fell in the dark
I could have died
It's crazy to remember all the reasoning
I wonder if the memory will ever fade away 
I looked at your Father and I smiled
He said it was time for me to go
Stumbling out into the morning
Hoping my feelings didn't show
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started

Just got out of school

With his girlfriend on the back seat
Looking for some action
And they found it down a back street
Suddenly a truck pulled out
He tried to step on the brake

Oh well her skin it was softer than velvet
And her eyes were as bright as a child's
Her lips were a promising picture
Warm and celluloid
But her words had me thinkin' too deeply
The meaning be-lying her face
Made me look just a little bit closer
Between the lines 
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there 
She said you've got to be seen at the Roxy
The strippers will know who we are
But you've got to be seen to be happy
You're a Tinseltown Star
You're going upwards and downwards and sideways
Man you're really caught up in a dream
With your head burning under the starlight
From the studio scene  
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there

L.A. insatiable, you don't have to go
L.A. charisma 
Well she knows all the famous musicians
Sometimes she sees how they play
And when the back stage passes are going
She really knows how to pay
She's a product of rock 'n' roll livin'
She's a victim of Hollywood hate
She's a soul survivor
She's the midnight special
Gonna lay you to waste 
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there

Last Night 
Last night
You know you really really
made me appreciate my life
When you took me to the seventh floor
And closed the door
I didn't stand a chance
Oh oh that night
When my conscience was losing
in that age old fight
Now I've always been a non-believer
A true deceiver
A hit and run romance 
Don't you know that when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere 
Last night
When the feeling was missing
but the mood was right
From the moment we took the floor
I knew for sure
We'd play the parts we're expected to
I've done it so many times 
Man we're all inmates of the human zoo
Our bodies in control of our minds
I played the jester and you played the fool
You kept forgetting your lines
I had to prompt you with a bourbon or two
Huh, you planned to come all the time 
But when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere (nowhere) 
Oh last night
You know you really really
gave me something to write about
In the morning it was just the same
I'd lost again
But it won't take me long to forget
Oh oh last night

Les Nouveaux Riches 
I could see that the sun it was deadly
She's putting her hand in the fire
Her velvety skin it was cooking
Lily white, lily white turning to raspberry
But when she slips in between the sheets tonight
the memory will linger and burn
And when she look at the face in the mirror
What a terrible sight
Lily white turning to raspberry
(When it burns you rub on the lotion
if it stings you sit in the ocean, oh no)

tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
they set jet away, they don't

I could see that the guys were a hassle
She tried to handle them cool
But her interbreeding was showing
tumbling out on the banks of the old
swimming pool, oh oh oh
So she buried her fears in a bottle
the juices beginning to flow
But her stiff upper lip it was trembling
tripping her up, her words were beginning to roll
Hush your mouth, you can't fool the natives
telegraph, they's going to relay it, oh no

tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine

I remember the tears in her eyes
She tried to hide them away
But her time it was going too quickly
Just another few days, she'll soon be flying away
But her memory will stay here forever
A time she will never forget
All the sun and the sand and the water
Such a beautiful place, she never got her feet wet
No way, she keeping a cool head
She got a tan, from under the sun bed, oh no

Life Is A Minestrone 
I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up
She gets more fan mail than the Pope
She takes the mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia 
Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze 
I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging round the gardens of Madison 
And the seat of learning
And the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante 
Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
Love is a fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crepe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne

Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 
Livin' it up in the paradise
Don't make it right, don't make it wrong
When you know you've got a friend
who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line 
But a walk on the wire
It don't put out no fire
A telephone line's like a life line 
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 
When you wake you'll find me sleepin'
The clock don't stop when you're not here
But you know you've got a friend
Who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line
A telephone line is a life line

Listen With Your Eyes 
I don't need no special things to get me high
All I needs a touch of Ron to get me by
I see people travelling, never make a move
I don't follow my leader, needles in the groove
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
People selling me heaven, praying to the sky
I don't read their message
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes (I love it) 
You've had a hustling day
Your life's roundabout anyway
I got my feet on the ground
That doesn't mean I don't get around
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
I love to see a daybreak
It's not a chemical wide awake
I like a rub in the tub
I never want to pull out the plug
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
Mr. Blue! 
People search the dailies, live by horoscope
Looking for direction, don't they get the joke
I won't fear the reaper, when the curtain falls
I'm not vegetating, waiting for the call 
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
Wake up to the future, you should make your plans
Dreams are made in heaven, life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands

Lost In Love 
A far bit beyond this place
All the stars have been cast
You may try to resist the pace
But it's happening too fast
The desire is so strong
Yeah you got to concede
There's no way to escape from the trap
We are slaves to our needs 
And we're lost in love
(Y'say) We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
And we're lost in love
(Say it) We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 
The stage has been set tonight
And the die has been cast
Curtain up and the music begins
Oh the audience cares???
Tragedy is feelin'
For the rest of your days
Nothing will ever compare to the thrill of the stage 
And we're lost in love
(I'm sayin') We're lost in our love and we can't find a way (baby, baby)
Lost in love (no, no)
(Sayin') We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 
Curtain will fall at the end of the day
Guardian angels will kill for their pay
Impossible dreams have to end
Let the crowd disappear, we've got nothing to fear 
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa

Lying Here With You 
Time to wave the day goodbye
But I don't wanna hear no lullaby
Sandman takes his cue
And when the night is through
I'll be lying here with you 
Close your eyes turn out the light
Say a prayer to see us through the night
Hope your dreams come true
When dawn turns into blue
I'll be lying here with you 
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do 
All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you 
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say

Man With A Mission 
There's a man at the top
And I know that he's pulling the strings
He's got his eye in the sky
And I know that he sees everything
There's a bug on the phone
Got his eye on the fly on the wall
But the man in the street doesn't know
'till the guillotine falls 
Then he drops before you realize
Bullets hit you right between the eyes 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
There's a voice in the air
And you welcome it into your home
But the snake in the grass
Is the power behind the throne
While you sit in your castle
The enemy's scaling the wall
If you don't make a sound
There'll be no one to answer your call 
The evidence is there in black and white
Your number's up for grabs if you don't fight 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave 
Open your eyes - see the lies while you dance in the dirt
Open your eyes - to the lies while you still got a chance
Open your mind - and you find that you're locked in a trance
Stars in your eyes - they make you blind this is not a romance 
The evidence is there in black and white
How long will it take you to see the light? 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in your door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave I'm a man with a mission
Yeh, I'm a man with a mission

Margo Wants The Mustard 
I watch her move up and down the beach, well
The fellows drool, but she's out of their reach, and
These are not a part of the scheme, but
Let them hope, and let them dream
So many dreams in the mind of the men, well
Come to life through a good woman
Margo walks in another place, well
It's in her eyes and it's on her face 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got  
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on her life
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top 
She's only got to smile that way well
It lifts your heart, blows your troubles away, and
When she moves, well I've got to say that
This rhythm method goes a long, long way
It's in the bones, and it's in the head
A precious thing that's got to be fed, well
I shouldn't say it, but it must be said
It's even better when it's in your bed 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
She'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top
(A wop bop a loo mop, a lop bom bom) 
I can't explain what she motivates, but
It's all around, but it's hard to relate
It must be close to heavenly bliss oh
How I wish I could bottle this and
I'd splash it out all over the place
Pour it over the human race, yeh
I may be starting another sin, but
Sit right back, watch the fun begin 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard

Marriage Bureau Rendezvous 
Well I've been lookin' after number one for too long
And it seemed the love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you 
Well a lonely man needs a Marriage Bureau
Where they sit you right down and you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall 
Oh no, too many questions 
I'm looking for a girl like Momma used to be
She's cooking up a dream, she's baking ecstasy
Won't it be fine when
I find her 
Would I like to take her to a movie or the theatre
Would I pick her up at home or would I like to meet her
Somewhere we could take a good look at each other
Smile and say hello or walk away
Smile and say hello or walk away 
So I'm squeaky clean in and out of the bath
I never shaved so close before
I'm gonna put on a tie, I'm gonna shine up my shoes
I'm gonna slick back my hair, I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, oh, I'll be stinkin' so good
like I'm drowning in a sea of cologne 
Hey... do you know you remind me of someone
But I'm here making eyes at you
And I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau
Close the files, turn the page, start anew
Close the files, turn the page, start anew

Memories 
The summers were longer, they went on forever
Oh and the sky so blue
We never worried about anything
We didn't question the nature of things
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 
We dream in the night, of mythical days
And nights in white satin
But when the child wakes, the fantasy breaks
We didn't know what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Something was growing inside me
Oh and I loved you so 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 
Photographs, faded photographs
Holidays, summer holidays
First love, broken promises
All a play, I'm going back to yesterday 
The feeling was stronger, if went on forever
Oh and your eyes were true
We were so wrapped up in all of our dreams
We didn't care what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so...... 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you

Modern Man Blues 
I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more, no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more 
Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside, hey 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone 
Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
And get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck, hey 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

Notell Hotel 
I checked into the room and I checked the view
And then I locked and chained the door
I had time to kill I had space to fill
Like a prisoner on the floor
But then the silence broke, there's a woman
screaming down the hall
And I wondered what was going on
Here at the Notell Hotel 
So I killed the light and I slipped the chain
took a peek into the hall
I was just in time to see the waiter trip
and drop the dinner on the floor
But the Bellboy smiled as the elevator started to fall
And I wondered what was going on
down at the Notell Hotel 
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous 
I heard the sound of feet and I looked out to
meet a girl I knew I'd seen before
She had the kind of looks, you see in dirty books
and she was dripping on the floor
She was taking a shower when someone tiptoed in
and turned out the lights
It's gonna be one of those nights
down at the Notell Hotel 
I took her into my room and picked the lock on the bar
to get a drink to calm her down
Then the mirror cracked as the window shook
and the table turned around
And when I grabbed at the phone
there was a voice at the end of the line
"Is that 1059? Is anything wrong, Is there anything wrong"
here at the Notell Hotel 
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)

Nothing Can Move Me 
There's talk about some people
That maybe you know
The heroes and the villains
And the places that they know 
The highest and the finest
The lowest of the low
Just stop and get it through you
There's somewhere you can go 
Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I'll tell you what I do when I'm blue
Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I close my eyes and think about you 
[CHORUS]
('Cause) nothing can move me like my rock n roll
Nothing can blow me away
Nothing can move me like my rock n roll do
Nothing can move
Nothing can move
Nothing can move me away 
You wake up in the morning
The wrong side of the bed
The spirit that was in you
is hammering your head 
You crawl up to your hi fi
Select a side or two
Sharpen up your needle
and feel it coming through

You promised me a life
You promised me everything would change
Even said you'd be my wife

Oh Effendi 
In the middle of a caravan
On a four wheel drive oasis
There's a man with a thought in mind
To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For your harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases 
There's a real, big demand
And it's written in the palm of his hand
He's gonna change the face of the desert
He's gonna sweep away the sand 
Hang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak
I ain't here, I'm a mirage
Get back Des, keep it under your fez
And don't give us away in the massage 
Look what I did for the pyramid
I put a pool in and made it pay
I built an elevator and a film theatre
And I shipped it to the U.S.A. 
'Cos there's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of my hand
I'm gonna change the face of the desert
I'm gonna sweep away the sand 
Hang on friends!
There's a lot more goodies in the pipeline
So this ain't the time to close the deal
Here's the deal
Ooh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own
Ooh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home
Gun running is fun
But hang on, friends, hang on friends 
Allah be praised, there's a whole new craze
We're gonna shoot up the foreign legion
And it's up with the sheik
And down with the frog
We're gonna liberate the region! 
Oh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand
Oh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land 
Hey, Prince of the moonbeams
Son of the Sun,
Light of a thousand stars
Your gorillas are urban
And there's bourbon on your turban
And the sun shines out of your ass 
Oh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake
Oh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake 
You're gonna cut out my liver
If I don't deliver
Things are getting out of hand
I'm going to ride off into the sunset and
Make a deal with the promised land 
Goodbye friends
There's no more goodies in the pipeline

Old Mister Time 
He looked funny
The children called him the scarecrow
An old raincoat
And baggy trousers and sneakers
he found at the dump
Oh, but if you bothered to look
There was something behind the rags
Oh there was a look in his eyes
It was something you'd never forget 
He lived badly
A broken shack on the railway
An old moggy
The only one who replied
When he talked to the walls
Oh we didn't understand
We were fooled by the dirt on his face
Oh we were human then
We were searching behind his disgrace 
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone 
You're never gonna realise
When all you do is criticise
You're never gonna make it work
You never seem to get enough
You crumble when its getting rough
You're never gonna make it work
I'm tellin' you there'll come a day
You're gonna blow yourselves away
It's wrong that I should interfere
I just get in the way 
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone 
Deep into the night
He was working by the light
of the candle by his bed
on the theory in his head
He was building from the junk
that he rescued from the dump
And when he turned the power on
There was a sound and he was gone 
Oh in the gray of the dawn
We discovered the thing he was working on
Oh we didn't understand
The future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)

Only Child

No brother to tell my troubles to
My nights were oh so sad and lonely
Until the day that I met you

Don't want to lose what I have found
'Cause I'm an only child

Overdraft In Overdrive 
I got a letter this morning
My overdraft's in overdrive
They wanna know what I'm gonna do about it
How I'm proposing to survive
Stay alive stay alive oooh
They want the money
so I work and work and work ......
They're making me roast
The cheque's in the post
You needn't worry worry worry....
You hit the roof when I'm on the floor
Did I ever let you down before 
I got a letter from my broker
He say he broker than me
My silver mine has tarnished over
I'm on the road to tragedy
Help me, help me, oooooh
I need the money
so I work and work and work.....
I'm deeper in debt, I'm covered in sweat
You make me worry, worry, worry....
This nightmare's giving me the shakes
Hope I wake and find it's all a mistake 
I started with nothing, and worked my way down
I know the things that I do, they mystify you
It's a strange way of living
But I like playing with fire
I'm always walking the wire
And when the tightrope snaps
You'll see my world collapse 
I got a letter this morning
Must be my lucky day
Seems I've inherited a fortune
Rich Uncle Sam passed away, away, away, ooooh
I'm in the money
No more work and work and work.....
My banker's aghast, I'm dripping with cash
No need to worry, worry, worry.....
You need an angel to survive

Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night 
Look at the smile in her eyes

I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go 
People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be 
Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell us it's time to go

Ready To Go Home 
On the street below these walls
Where I used to walk
Now I can barely crawl
All this darkness rising tall
Lord shine a light for me
I'm waiting to be called 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
Take this river to the sea
Where the Delta flows
The tide is washing over me
Guide this soul to Heaven's door
Show me where tomorrow lies
I'm waiting to be born  
I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home 
So tired I lay down
With these memories
Breathe shallow deep inside of me
If time has run its course with me
Then 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
When the evening shadows fall
When the time has come
I'll let defences fall
To surrender's to survive
I will give up everything
To those I leave behind 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home
Again

Reds In My Bed 
There's a fat man who offers a change of scene
Says he'll guarantee my sheet will be clean
When I get on the outside
But who can you trust when the walls have ears
I'm for takin' a chance, like a drownin' man
I'm going under 
I've got reds in my bed
I'm not easily led to the slaughter
And while the cold war exists
I'll stay warm with the commisar's daughter 
We could meet at the zoo where the tiger roams
In a prison of steel
He reminds me so much of the way I feel
And we know that we're both in the danger zone
Where the eyes of the world
Full of shutters and bugs are upon us now 
I've got reds in my bed
I get blues looking out of my window
And we're never alone, there's a tap on the phone
And my pillow 
Let me go home
(There's a girl in a distant land)
Let me go home
(Who's nothing more than a memory)
She don't know that I'm gonna be free
Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
I don't like your philosophy
I don't like your philosophy 
The connections are made and the time is right
So my body is walled in the shell of a car
in the dead of night
And I laugh through the pain and the agony
As they cut me away to be born again
back to humanity 
You've got reds in your bed
There's a man lookin' over your shoulder
But don't you give him your mind
It's too late when you find that it's over
You! 
Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy

Rock 'n' Roll Lullaby 
Listen while I sing you to sleep
With a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Close your eyes and don't you peep
This is a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Sandman's gonna get you 
Snuggle down your sleepy head
It's gettin' late the Sandman said
Your dreams are waiting
It's daybreak in the land of nod
So get to sleep you little sod
Your dreams are waiting 
And if you get a nightmare
Would you go and shake your Ma
Cause your Daddy's been a workin' all day
And if you go and get a glass of water by yourself
You can show us that you're older than you are
Show us that you're older 
The Sandman's gonna get you 
Well you're too small to understand 
You're living in a wonderland
Your dreams are waitin' 
If only we could be there too
And dream a dream along with you
Your dreams are waitin' 
Careful that you don't get out the wrong side of the cot
Are you gonna be an angel or a devil
You're too small to reason what is right and what is wrong
Childhood dreams are gone too fast
There's no way we can make them last 
We'll always love you anyway
Any way you are
Any way you are

Rubber Bullets 
I went to a party at the local county jail
All the cons were dancing and the band began to wail
But the guys were indiscreet
They were brawling in the street
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Well the band were playing
And the booze began to flow
But the sound came over on the police car radio
Down at Precinct 49
Having a tear-gas of a time
Sergeant Baker got a call from the governor of the county jail 
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets 
I love to hear those convicts squeal
It's a shame these slugs ain't real
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail 
Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail
And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail
There's a rumor goin' round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow
At the local hop at the local county jail 
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do 
Sergeant Baker started talkin'
With a bullhorn in his hand
He was cool, he was clear
He was always in command
He said "Blood will flow;
Here Padre
Padre you talk to your boys..."
"Trust in me -
God will come to set you free" 
Well we don't understand
Why you called in the National Guard
When Uncle Sam is the one
Who belongs in the exercise yard
We all got balls and brains
But some's got balls and chains
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets 
Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance at the local county jail
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do

Runaway 
Remember I'm the one who didn't have a lot to say
I was trying to find the courage, but I let you walk away
And I can't forget your face, y'know it haunts me all the time
And it seems to me you're living in a dream 
[CHORUS]
Wish we could run away, and we could be alone together
Far away, and leave the world behind
Runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you 
Want to tell you what I'm thinking, but the words get in the way
When I'm sitting here alone I find the things I meant to say
If I wrote them in a letter, would you read between the lines
Would you understand how much I really care 
[CHORUS]
(I) I love you
(Need) I need you
(You) Don't want to live without you 
If I'm backward counting forward, would you help me realize
All the answers to the questions I've been asking with my eyes
I could hand you all the cliches, but you've heard them all before
And I want to say I love you in my own way 
[CHORUS]
And could we run away...

Sand In My Face 
I looked in the mirror
(What did you see looking at you?)
I saw a nine stone weakling
(What will you do?) 
Dynamic Tension waiting for you?
Dynamic Tension make a man out of you 
I opened my magazine
(What did you see?)
I saw Mr. France
(What did he have?)
A girl on each shoulder
(What else?)
And one in his pants 
Dynamic Tension can do this for you
Dynamic Tension make a man out of
You you you you you 
So our hero goes down to the beach
He's in real terrible shape
His chick's been seen with big Alex
That mother kicked sand in his face
Now let me tell you about Alex
He's got:
Hands like hams
Knees like trees
200 lbs
Of surfboard Hercules 
Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I lost my girl down by the beach
She's with Alex and she's out of reach
So please Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I saw your body in an advert on T.V.
But what convinced me was your money back guarantee 
Now I'm stronger than Alex
(Where is he now?)
He's left in disgrace
(Oh yeah?)
'Cos I took back my girlfriend
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And kicked sand in his face
(In his eyes, in his ears, in his nose) 
Dynamic Tension waiting for you
Dynamic Tension make a man out of you

Shine A Light In The Dark 
i've been lost before and i had to pay
it was never easy but i found a way
well the journey was hard and the road was tough
there were times when i cried lord i've had enough
please don't desert me now
don't you leave me stranded now i need a friend
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 
i've been down and out and i've been fit to drop
but the thought of you wouldn't let me stop
now a man should stand upon his own two feet
because the taste of failure is a bitter sweet
please don't desert me now
i can hear the reaper calling in the wind
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 
where were you when the chips were down
i fell apart when i hit the town
where were you when i couldn't get arrested
where were you when the lights went out
i blew a fuse, did you hear me shout
where on earth do i look for heavens sake 
there's a brotherhood that i want to see
gotta take my share of equality
there's no harmony in a one man band
even god almighty needs a helping hand
please don't desert me now
there's no time and i can't fight another day
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark

Ships Don't Disappear In The Night (Do They) 
Ships don't just disappear in the night
Do they?
People don't really die of fright
Do they?
We all know it just ain't so 
So don't be afraid when the table shakes
Don't you
Don't be amazed when your shadow quakes
Don't you
Start to pray they'll go away 
And then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 
Better be nice to Vincent Price 
Forces at work that we don't understand
Are they?
So don't get the shits if it touches your hand
Don't you
Poltergeists can be so nice 
Better be nice to Vincent Price 
What's that noise comin' up from the cellar?
What's it?
It's the restless bones of Boris and Bela
Boris and Bela
Don't go down, they're still around 
But then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 
And then they can't do nothin' to ya
They can't do nothin' to ya
They just keep walkin' through ya

Shock On The Tube (Don't Want Love) 
I was travelling home on the subway
When this vision got on at Maida Vale
And as I casually eyed the classifieds
She sat down next to me
Every head in the carriage was wondering
I replied with a smile on my face
And as I slipped into the arms of Morpheus
To daydream the rest of the way 
She was a smooth operator
You could see it in her dress
I said I'd like to see you later
But I didn't want to press 
I was homing like a scanner
Did a mental strip tease
But she knew that she was special
And she came on like a tease 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 
She was a headstrong woman
With a demon in her blood
Through the window in her eyes
I saw fire in her soul
And I knew if I pursued it
My fingers would be burned
Like a moth round a candle
I was momentarily stunned 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 
The carriage was spinning
We were up on the floor
She was whirling like a dervish
I was whirling like a fool
My reactions were dimming
Like an alcoholic haze
I could hear people clapping
I was stumbling in a daze
I was stumbling in a daze
My eyes tried to focus
I was suddenly aware
She was newborn naked
I was altogether bare
There were shouts all around us
There were clothes on the floor
As I tried to find my senses
I was sliding down the door 
Down a coal black tunnel
I was slipping away
Then I felt the water hit me
And I heard somebody say
Better get yourself together
This is the end of the line
When I looked for my woman
I'd been dreaming all the time 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love

Silly Love 
Hey toots, you put the life into living
You brought a sigh into sight
Ah hon, you make my legs turn to water
You bring the stars out at night
But they ain't half so bright
As your eyes 
Gee whiz, you take the beauty out of beautiful
You play the strings of my heart
Oh babe, you take the wonder out of wonderful
Oh my, oh my, and my, if you were mine
The rain would turn to sweet sweet wine 
Well he's been up all night
Breakin' his head in two to write
A little sonnet for his chickadee
But between you and me
I think its sssssssssssilly. Silly 
Ooh treas, you got a smile like a Rembrandt
Aha, you got the style of a queen
Oh dear, you are the petal of a rosebud
Next to you all the others could be weeds
You're the only one my garden needs 
Ooh, you know the art of conversation
Must be dying
Ooh, when a romance depends on
Cliches and toupees and threepes 
We're up to here with moonin' and junin'
If you want to sound sincere -
Don't rely on Crosby's croonin' -
Take a little time
Make up your own rhyme
Don't rely on mine
'Cos it's sssssssssilly - silly - silly - silly

Something Special 
stealing coins from the poor box
i'm robbing the blind, but you won't
understand, i'm a wanted man
got no choice in the matter
i'm mad as a hatter
but she makes me do
things i shouldn't do 
my baby wants the best of everything
i can't refuse her when she starts to sing
bring me something special
and i'll take you to heaven tonight 
going down to the street and
i'll pick on a pocket with a
healthy wad, from some wealthy sod
looking tough with a shooter
i'll stick up the bank
and take out, all that cash
i'll be, such a smash 
my baby needs the best of everything
lifes little luxuries to make her sing
bring me something special and i'll
take you to heaven tonight 
look at her face and i won't need to explain
this is the stuff dreams are made of
step in my shoes and you will feel no pain
she's got the power to knock your socks off 
my baby gets the best of everything
it's risky business but it makes her sing
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight 
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight

Somewhere In Hollywood 
Down on the casting couch
A star is gonna be born
A star with the stature of a Harlow
Who's doomed
And groomed to enrapture
All her co-stars, and stuntmen, the co-stars
Oh, let there be lights, action, sound
Lights, action, sound - Roll 'em! 
Out in the mezzanine
On the arm of a dumb marine
Her beauty looks out like a trailer
Norman Mailer
Waits to nail her
He's under the bed
And he's waiting for her to be dead
He's out on the patio
With his polaroid and scenario
And he's armed and he's dangerously.... 
Close was the weather
When I was a kid
She gave me a feather from her gown
To cool me down, to cool me down
And I was the galley slave
Who lost his heart when the ship went down 
Lights, action, sound
Roll 'em 
I had a part in the talkies
When you were a little girl
I've taken Lassie for walkies
When she was the pup that Vaudeville threw up
And destiny lead her
Hand in paw to somewhere
In Hollywood 
That's crazy, a dog up in Beverly Hills
Crazy, crazy 
La, la, la, la, la.... (You better lie low)

Strange Lover 
Baby Baby Baby don't hurry
You've got your finger on me
Don't let go, no no no
I know you love it
It's running through my veins
You drink me dry
You take so much of me
And when you touch me
I see the magic in your eyes
And I can't move (I'm going under)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever  
Baby Baby don't make me worry
You only live for the night
It's not right, no no no
But in the morning
You seem to disappear
Here come the night
You seem to reappear
Is this a warning?
I've got a feeling you're not
Telling me the truth (you cast no shadow)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever 
Strange Lover, pale as the moon
You've no shadow, no face in the mirror
No complection, no reflection 
Baby Baby Baby you're freezing
You send a shiver through me
I'm so cold, no no no
The day is dawning
We're moving underground
I must go with you
I start to realise
Your touch is deadly
I wanna look away
But I can't look away
I'm in your power and I'm lost

Survivor 
This boy he's a midnight driver
High roller and a soul survivor
She tried to send him on his way
He say, hey, I wanna stay
If you don't mind I'm hanging around 
This girl's on the road to nowhere
She wouldn't say but another day there
It's not the role she's decided to play
She say, hey, don't wanna stay
There's no reason for hanging around 
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be 
Listen, I know what she's like she's just a dreamer
But I'll win in the end I'm a schemer
Give her time she'll be on the phone
She's never gonna make it alone
Better leave the door on the latch
She'll soon be hurrying home
Oh Mother, it looks like I'm in for stormy weather
So I'd better get my story together
Got to make it good she's no fool
I'll take her in my arms, I'll be cool
Don't want to get her upset
I wanna make her forget 
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be 
This girl's she's a real survivor
She don't believe in the midnight driver
So she's starting a brand new day
She say, hey, don't wanna play
It had to stop, so I'm going away
I'm going away

Baby baby oh baby
I'd love to love you
But my hands are tied
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are killing me 
You don't need money if you've got love

Break these chains

Take these chains
Take these chains 
She never thought that I could live without her
All the little things she used to do
Then I fell in love with you
You found me
You took me in
When no one wanted me 
Making love on a sandy beach
The stars above us and we're clean out of reach
Of my chains
oh oh the chains that were killing me 
And you make everything a paradise
And paradise with you is twice as nice
Never change, never change what you're doing to me 
Never change

Take This Woman 
I found myself on my knees in prayer
The consequence of my deep despair
Now I must speak, get it off my chest
It ain't no joke and it ain't no jest 
Every night she would come to me
But her demands brought disharmony
I said, "You can't bring your drums to bed,
Your rhythm method's gonna leave me dead." 
Got to take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away  
It would be churlish of me to complain
But caviar every night is insane
I'm fit to burst, I'm not in the mood
But she say, "Lie down babe, I wanna talk to you." 
Well I'm not fond of your family ties
The hangman's noose in your mother's eyes
You chatterbox like a talking head
Je ne comprends pas the words that you said 
Take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
Don't want to love you
I really tried
But I'm hook line and sinkered deeply fried
I've got to admit that with all your faults
We touch and it feels like a million volts 
Listen - I realised I'd made a big mistake
I'm only human for heaven's sake
Lord give me strength don't let me falter
I'm gonna take her to the alter 
And I'll take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away 
I'm gonna take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away

Don't want it to

Leave us alone we don't wanna go home
Put your chairs on the tables

Time to take your home
Time to say goodnight

Let's be together tonight
Let's be together tonight 
Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way

Gotta cross town back to my place
Pull the shades down screw the rat race

Hang the sign out don't disturb

The Anonymous Alcoholic 
You walk in the room
The folks are all there
With glasses in hand
But you can't take the band
So you head for the bar
The barman's well stocked
He knows where you're at
He offers a drink
But you can't take none of that
(No you can't take none of that) 
Everybody's having fun
So why be the one
Who's out in the cold
It's not good enough
You made a deal with yourself
You said you'd never take another drop
Your craving's big, your livers shot
You'd give a million for a solitary drop 
You take your first belt
It tastes like pure hell
The second one drops
Intentions are shot
Well you think you might as well
You take another sip
You get to likin' it
The music sounds hip
So you head for the floor
(So you head for the floor)
Yea yea yea yea yea 
Well you step out on the dance floor
And you grab at your boss's wife
You've been longing to hold her close
For the whole of your working life
And the band played on 
Move your ass 
Well your hostess is lookin' mad
As your hands start to wander
And your boss is gonna get you now
He's gonna put you six feet under
You get walked out the door
And your feet don't touch the floor
You're never gonna see 'em no more 
The dawn starts to break
Your heads a big ache
You're lyin' in bed
You're back from the dead
And your mouth feels like old leather

Never do it again

Everyone was havin' fun
But you were the one
Kicked out in the cold
You slept in your clothes
You let 'em down
Down at the club
You know your confidence got to take the rub
Your boss is sore
You've had your chance
He says he never wants to see you again
Don't wanna see you again
(Don't wanna see you again)

The Dean And I 
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways 
Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered "I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol"
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, your head goes round and round
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train 
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways 
Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy 
Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Now!

The Film Of My Love 
Co-starring you
And co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love 
Will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance
A scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind
On the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven 
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over 
A close-up of yours
A long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you
With a love that is true
In cinemascope forever 
A clapper board kiss
There's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss whatever
A box office wedding
A premier for two
We'll be on location forever 
When Pathe recall
The thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic 
An epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace
That time can't erase
Let them censor the wind
Or the weather
The film of my love 
Will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever 
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and over

The Hospital Song 
Nobody sends me birthday cards
Nobody brings me flowers
I'm just here for operations
I've been out for hours 
When I come to I'll wet my bed
'Cos when I get mad I sink so low
As matron knows
I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeh, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me 
And when I go to that seedy ward
Up in the sky
You'll be waiting
With a hypodermic needle
And a graph 
Here comes the dark
(I'm grateful for my anaesthetic)
Out goes the spark
(Delirious and apathetic) 
When I come to
I'll wet my bed
And when I get well
I'll take revenge
I'll wreak my wrath
On all blood donors
And their sisters
Visiting time and flowers
When sister brings that bedpan round
I'll piss like April showers 
I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeh, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me 
And when I go
I'll die of plaster casting love

The Monkey And The Onion 
See the monkey peel the onion
See the monkey cry
He can feel his tears are flowin'
But he don't know why 
He continues peeling faster
'Til the onion is no more
Now at last his cryin's over
But all he had is gone
Whatever for 
You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 
If I tell you that I love you
Don't ask how much
And don't ask why
Have no doubt and ask no questions
Just believe it's not a lie 
Never take my love for granted
But never put it to the test
Like the monkey and his onion
Too much investigation
You know the rest 
You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 
On that we could be contented
With the good things that we've gained
But in the end we're empty handed
Just because we need the world explained

The Power Of Love 
Momma don't mind, cause your momma don't know
But if your poppa finds out that we're all alone
He's gonna change your mind and rearrange my bones 
Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 
Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
Turn the lights down low (lights down low)
And the hi fi high (hi fi high)
Put the lock on the door, pull the curtains too
Don't want the world to know, I'm getting close to you 
Well you never see it (never see it)
But you sure can feel it (sure can feel it)
And if you get the taste, you get the hunger pains
You'll be hooked for life, never be the same 
Everybody's gonna see
There's no escaping from the mystery
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
So you're sitting in a restaurant
And you feel so nonchalant
When the waiter says "what'll it be"
You start to speak, then suddenly
A pretty girl walks 'cross the floor
You ain't thinking 'bout food - no more 
'Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 
Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)

The Second Sitting For The Last Supper 
Another fish head in the dustbin
Another loser in the queue for the soup kitchen
Another reason for a visit
We think you'd better come down 
Another nigger on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told
Was so wrong, so wrong 
'Cos you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified 
The second coming of the Holy Ghost
We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper 
Another Guru in the money
Another mantra in the mail
An easy way from rags to riches
God's little acre's up for sale 
The time is right for ressurection
We think you'd better come down
The church don't ring with hallelujahs
You haven't been for so long
So long, so long 
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper

The Secret Life Of Henry 
Early morning
I'm still yawning
Kiss the children
See you tonight dear
Cheerio 
Henry's an angel when he closes the gate
But to the station he don't want to be late
His manner changes as he steps on the train
Beneath his bowler (hat) lies a schizophrenic brain
Oh he wants to flirt and Yes he's looking up the skirts 
He want to meddle with a body
He want to tamper with your mind
Sooner or later
He's gonna rip us his paper
He's gonna bring his fantasy
Out of the closet and into reality 
Henry's a devil when he get to this job
Won't take a break, he want to get to the top
No getting credit when the credit is due
He wants the glory and he'll crucify you 
Ten years, no promotion
Now he's gonna make them sit up (sit up)
He's been the brain behind the business
So, shut up (shut up)
And put your money where you mouth is 
Sooner or later
He's gonna take the computer
And take the information
He'll make a killing in the city
And they'll never, never, never ever know 
All alone
Sitting in his zanzibar
Dreamin' and schemin'
A plan of action but he won't get very far
Another skin-full 
Two more tequilas and he'll rule the world 
This is a rat-trap (mere existence)
He's really losing face (resistance)
I hear he's headin' for disaster
The fool will never beat the master now 
It's very late, he staggers back to the shop
There's something wrong if he's not back on the dot 
It's so astounding as he falls through the door 
He takes his lunch and passes out on the floor
Oh it's not his fashion
Usually keeps his passion hidden (hidden)
They'll never see him in the same way
Driven (driven)
He won't forget the things he did today 
Sooner or later
He's gonna rip us his paper
He's gonna bring his fantasy
Out of the closet and into reality 
Hello darlin'
How's your day been?
Can't complain dear
Same as usual

The Stars Didn't Show 
we came from miles around
just to listen to your sound
you made the night seem endless
you cast a magic spell
you played the part so well
your music blew away the darkness 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show 
you made me stand so proud
i was lifted from the crowd
the fire inside me burning
the figure dressed in black
sending shivers down my back
deep inside my soul was stirring 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
the sweet inspiration that you gave us
and i can remember we didn't rehearse
the night that the stars didn't show 
mountains may crumble
and worlds fall apart
lovers and friends may desert me
the road may be long
but i know in my heart
your spirit will always be with me 
the thrill to be up there
a sea of faces everywhere
i look i find you 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse

The Worst Band In The World 
It's one thing to know it but another to admit
We're the worst band in the world
But we don't give a.... 
If Garbo played guitar with Valentino on the drums
Then we'd be nothing more than a bunch of darma bums
So tune up, tune up 
Well we've never done a days work in our life
And our records sell in zillions
It irrigates my heart with greed
To know that you adore me
Up yours, up mine
But up everybody's that takes time -
But we're working on it
Working on it (Ooh) 
We never seen the van - leave it to the roadies -
Never met the roadies - leave them in the van
All because of circumstances way beyond control
We became the darlings of this thing called rock and roll, ooh 
Here I am a record on a jukebox
A little piece of plastic with a hole, ooh
Play me
Buy me and you play me then my plastic turns to gold 
Here we are together on your hi fi
A little piece of plastic with a hole, oh
Fade me, fade me, fade me, fade me.....

Things We Do For Love 
Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. 
Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. 
Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. 
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. 
Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. 
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. 
A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love....

With your beauty you nearly blinded me
In your beauty I want to stay 
I bow to you with my heart
I think of you every day
When I dream you are there beside me
But when I waken you're far away 
Perfection, in miniature
With tiny hands, smiling eyes

Tomorrow's World Today 
I'll tell you something you oughta know
We came a long way from the radio
But what's wrong with that?
Baby's what's wrong with that? 
Now we got microchips, sci fi flicks
We got tomorrow's world today 
Now there's something that I gotta say
Do you remember only yesterday
We had Blue Suede Shoes
Yeh, and we had Howard Hughes 
Now we got holograms, CB hams
We got tomorrow's world today 
At a time when the world is changing
Faster than ever before
Don't lose sight of the human touch
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 
Now the children of the future
May take a trip to Mars
They might meet the Space Invaders on their way
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 
Wish I had a calculator when I was at school
I was a simple mathematical fool
But now all that's changed
Yeh, we got computer games 
And we got transplants, sperm banks
and body scanners
All there to help us survive
So we should think we're lucky
We got tomorrow's world today

Wall Street Shuffle 
Do the Wall Street shuffle
Hear the money rustle
Watch the greenbacks tumble
Feel the Sterling crumble 
You need a yen to make a mark
If you wanna make money
You need the luck to make a buck
If you wanna be Getty, Rothschild
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street 
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street
When your index is low
Dow Jones ain't got time for the bums
They wind up on skid row with holes in their pockets
They plead with you, buddy can you spare the dime
But you ain't got the time
Doin' the....
Doin' the.... 
Oh, Howard Hughes
Did your money make you better?
Are you waiting for the hour
When you can screw me?
'Cos you're big enough 
To do the Wall Street Shuffle
Let your money hustle
Bet you'd sell your mother
You can buy another 
Doin' the....
Doin' the.... 
You buy and sell
You wheel and deal
But you're living on instinct
You get a tip
You follow it
And you make a big killing 
On Wall Street

Welcome To The World 
You're through gestation so welcome to the world
We've still got vacancies just waiting to be filled
We're still delivering ten thousand souls a day
And disproportionately packing them away 
The starving of the multitudes and the feeding of the few
We're only humanoid there's nothing we can do
You must do something or we'll all go up in smoke
We'd like to help but we're afraid of losing votes 
They never listen to you
They never listen to your cries
We're not progressing we're only marking time
You're on your own 
Think of your children
Think of your children
Are they welcome to the world?  
If every Chinaman jumped up and down in sync
Then California would be sucked into the drink
You've all got bodies and a few of you got minds
We'd like to juse them but we never get the time 
Though man's achievements are a credit to us all
How come we're stading with our backs against the wall?
One thousand congressmen assemble every day
They'll send us packing on a dreadlock holiday 
They'll never listen to you
They'll never listen to your cries
They'll keep on talking and wasting precious time
You're on your own 
Think of your children
Think of your children
Look to your children
They're only children
Are they welcome to the world?

We've Heard It All Before 
Einstein, he said, nothings original
Find something new, That's easy for him to say
Took his whole life explaining his theory
Try squeezing your life into 3 minute songs like 
"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 
Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before
Don't wanna hear it anymore
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 
We've come a long way from mono to stereo
Mozart would freak at the crap on the radio
Hits are produced by computer technology
Stick it in one end and it comes out the other 
"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 
Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before

We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 
You plug us in and we regurgitate the hits
Bombard your senses with sound of microchips
Program it digitally into the top five
Brainwash your ears, is it tape or is it live?...live, live, live.. 
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)

Why Did I Break Your Heart 
Inside my loneliness and sorting through the mess
I came across a bunch of snaps and letters
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when
It took me back to when we found each other 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
The tender parts we played
I thought we had it made
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion
But when the love turned sour
I found the happy hour
But drinking for the world is no solution 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Why did I break your heart 
The cost of loving is a heavy burden
Somebody's gotta take the strain
The things we said would make a cover story
But who's gonna say
Who should take all the blame 
We analysed ourselves
It didn't really help
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason
I thought we had the best
But when you flew the nest
My heart decided it was open season 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Why did I break your heart....

Woman In Love 
i don't know why it's the way of the world
but meanwhile.... 
you've seen her sway when she walks down the street
look at her eyes see the glow in her cheeks
it ain't no secret she can't hide it away
there's someone special she's the dish of the day 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love

this chemistry you'll never find in a book
no Ectochrome's gonna capture this look
these mixed emo's make your senses to reel
you've got to be there to feel what she feels 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman 
why should a woman in all innocence
be the one to inspire looks that kill
i don't know
i don't know why it's the way of the world
some will win, some will lose
but she can't tell 
this kind of beauty comes from within
shouldn't be allowed yeh it's really a sin
you'd sell your soul for a night in her bed
you're far too late boy I've already said 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman

Wonderland 
i wanna take a giant step
don't know where I'll end up yet
the devil or the deep blue sea
there's always someone watching over me
the power of communication
every little word's a big sensation
sitting in the palm of my hand
everyone at my command 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
i'd like to introduce you to
a special substance, good for you
no physical dependency
for a star in its ascendancy
the world is a great big oyster
i'm riding through on a roller coaster
i'm looking at exotic places
but i'm colour blind to all these faces 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
live while you can
everyday's a holiday
these are the golden years
and they won't be coming round again
so little time to be wild and free
so many things that you want to be
so little space between the cradle and the grave
but the minutes are ticking away
these are the special times
and they won't be coming round again woh oh woh 
people take me for a ride
but I'm feeling good inside
the consequence of love and pain
and I'm not the one who takes the blame
my head is on another planet
my thoughts are soothed
by the hands upon it
a simple trade in real affection
and I'm not alone in the twilight zone 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
it's a wonderland....

Working Girls 
Working girls don't stand a chance
Typing pools are full deadly fish
Office Romeos believe
Dictation is the statutory dish 
Do they want you for your body
When you wanna use your mind
Every day it's hustle hustle
But you're not the pushy kind 
You worry and wonder when he calls you at five
You've got to work late will you get out alive
You know what he's after it's always the same
And soon you'll be playing the cat and mouse game 
Working girls they dress to kill
Posing for some glossy magazine
You know the flashman wants an exposure
But your momma says you gotta keep it clean 
Still you're selling with your body
And the camera never lies
Every shot is more revealing
As your inhibitions die 
He asks you to stay but you want to decline
He leers as he opens another bottle of wine
Don't want to offend him your ticket to fame
So you play by the rules
It's a cat and mouse game 
Working girls are lost in dreams
Buried in a paperback romance
Why don't you wake up to reality
And watch those fingers at the office dance 
When you're struggling with your figures
Is he studying your form?
There's a silence in the boardroom
It's the calm before the storm 
You wanna go home it's been a long day
The streets are so crowded and you must get away
You'll be back tomorrow
He'll call out your name
It's business as usual
The cat and mouse game 
Working girls
Working girls

Yes, I Am 
You never asked me to love you
I did it all by myself
You didn't make me no promises
You read my feelings so well 
[CHORUS]
Oh wow wow what you've done for me
Oh wow wow even a fool could see
Oh wow wow what you mean to me 
You didn't ask no questions
I wouldn't tell you no lies
I didn't need any answers
They were there in your eyes
Don't stop me from falling
I can't get enough
You took the pain from my body
Now I'm ready for love
Yes I am 
I've been alone in the shadows
Too many nights by myself
So many dreams have been shattered
You know the story so well 
[CHORUS]
I didn't see no fireworks
And the earth never moved
But when we're lying together
I've got nothing to prove
You gave me your kisses I can't get enough
You put the fire in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am 
People try to analyse
They worry is it right
But it really doesn't matter to me
There's no reason when you really fall in love
'Cause you can't stop it
Won't drop it
Don't even think about it
Hold on tight and never let it go 
[CHORUS]
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am

You're Coming Home Again 
Baby, baby, don't you make a sound
All I'm asking of you is to understand
I can't let you go
When are you coming home again? 
It's so easy to be cold and proud
We should talk it over, we should shout it out
I can't let you go, no no no
When are you coming home again? 
I never dreamed that you would go away
When we had a quarrel we could find a way
But I woke up this morning and I knew it
You were gone 
It's no party when you realize
That you're on your own, nobody hears you cry
You can't believe it, oh baby
When are you coming home again? 
I've been foolish and I brought you down
But I'll make it better, won't you hold me close
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 
I'm no poet, but I tell you so
You're the woman I care for, won't you ever know
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 
I can feel that you'll be coming around
If I hold on to you, can we make it right
I love you so, baby
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again

You've Got A Cold 
Your nose is runnin'
And your eyes are red
Your head is achin'
You'd be better in bed
From the bottom of your fever
To the throbbing in your toes
You've got a cold
You've got a cold 
You're searching madly
To find a cure
But the mercury's rising
To a hundred and four
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold 
Ain't no use in fightin' it
Get into bed and try to sweat it out 
Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can scream and shout it 
Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can't fight it 
Foreign bodies in your Kleenex
You've got no taste at all
While your system is dyin'
The bugs are havin' a ball
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

Yvonne's The One 
When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And her laughter flowed into my life
She seemed so right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
So I waited for the magic to start
Somebody touch me deep in my heart 
Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne" 
When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn't dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So I waited for the magic to start
But I know it's gonna tear us apart 
Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne"  
She'll never know how much I loved her
I never got to tell
We never had the chance to say farewell 
When I last saw Yvonne
She was covered in roses
But the laughter had gone from her eyes
She walked so tall, looked so grand
Everything about her truly planned
But what you get is not what you see
"So long Yvonne you're not fooling me" 
Yvonne's the one I've been counting on
She said, "Hold on, you're not the only one"
And so I said, "So long Yvonne"

Awkward Silence 
Another night
Another fight
What could be so wrong (be so wrong)
I wish we'd seen us
What could be between us
All along
Could this be our last dance
This awkward silence
When I look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
I watch you drive out
After all we talked bout
Try not to cry
I thought I knew (I thought I knew)
But I felt for you (But i fell for you)
I should have known (I should have known)
That I outgrow  (I now have grown)
These feelings I feel, No longer want to hide
I wish you were here, But your by my side
I know whatever I do
I'll do it for you

Morning After 
woke up next to you this morning, 
and it seemed that without warning, 
i fell in love with you again. 
and when i leave your house today,
 i wish that i could find a way, so i could stay. 
so i'll just think of that night, 
when everything seemed right, 
you held me in your arms all night long.
 i listened to you breathe, 
i didn't want to leave,
 so instead i guess i'll write this song. 
it seems like this was meant to be, 
whenever you spend time with me. 
i wish you'd open your eyes,
 then maybe you'd see, just how much you really mean to me. so now i'll think of all the stupid things i do,
 the way i feel messed up whenever i see you,
 the way i feel inside, emotions i can't hide, 
i hope things always stay this way.
 and now i promise you, 
there's nothing i won't do, 
you know that i'll always love you. 
and now i promise you,
 there's nothing i won't do, 
you know that i'll always love you.

The Neverending Sentence 
How close did i come?
perhaps i'll never know
the journey is so long
i wonder where it goes
the clock is ticking down
until my car explodes
the bacon now is frying
7 cm from my nose
will i make it in time?
will it my life?
driving down this similar road
the half-connected story told
of things that can happen on the way
But obviously not today
How close did i get?
to where i wanted to be
was i nearly there
or did my windscreen decieve me
apparently you can get cars 
that can invent a landscape
on the screen in front of you
until you make the mistake
of trying to be
what you blatantly aren't
maybe next August i'll see......

Victoria 
started that day, 
on the beach and under stars. 
you took my hand, 
we walked down to the sand. 
and since you've left, 
everytime the sun has set since, 
i've closed my eyes, 
and wished that you were by myside tonight. 
and now i wish instead, 
i was back there in your bed, 
watching stars, staring in silence. 
and words i longed to hear, 
poured from your lips to my ears. 
you said yes and then we kissed. 
remember when, it was time to go back home? 
we said goodbye, you kissed me one last time.

1000 Shattered Dreams 
In front of mirrors
I wait to be seen
holding the hurt with one hand
you scream
(I could change
take this picture in my head
and rip it up in front of 
what is holding me back)
(Chorus)
1,000 Shattered Dreams
it drowns the fire of what could be
take your faults and cancel them out
'cause it's broken fix it, broken fix me....
Fist full of sand falling through my fingers
like life which once held so much love
but this jaded hatred is all I have
to wish for, wish for....
to break me down again
(Where is the shortcut
I'm feeling you
I wish I was feeling you
now.......)

A Walk Around Inside My Head 
Take a day
and walk around inside my head
but you can stay
as long as you want
until you feel pressured to say
whichever this and that's will fail without no play
If you want it 
you can have it
pressures there 
just go away
I really want you
but I can't have you
straighten your life out
do what you wanna
just go away
Everyday
just go away
Clock strikes 9
but upside down it's 6
and I hate time
cause when it's 6 it's 9 and this wasted trip
down the way
all these months of silence, silence
Can't you stay?
because it's never enough, 
it's never enough today
Stare at the sun
blinding your eyes
feeling, this feeling
this dying inside (4x)

Best Left Unsaid 
I'll wait for the skies to pour on me, for you
Don't ask me why
It's all the things we couldn't say
These lonely eyes
Leave me feeling far away from you
Am I asking a bit too much from you
Don't let me stand in the way of dreams you have
A perfect vision of worlds colliding slowly
Melting in the flames of fires warmly glowing
Don't ask me why

Leave me feeling far away from you

with you

Breeze knock me over and over again
Now I'm waiting for you
Just make your move
and knock me over now
Face up, clever grin

Contradictions (Tribute To Our Lady Peace 
I hid from all your contradictions
and found that they had won
I blame myself for all your lonely tears
we always fought
I never thought we would have to wait

I'm wrong

If I don't make it known that 
I've loved you all along 
just like the sunny days that 
we ignore because 
they're all dumb and jaded

what's wrong 
I fall around myself 
not blinking
but thinking I had lost
I blame myself for being too much like 
everybody else 
I never thought I would just 
bend this way 
then you spoke and made me realize

but when there's only one there's none and I'll still be a whore
Knowing if I left that I'd be right back here with you

You close your eyes to see,     me

The hurt is gonna leave
Until you don't know what you got,
At least that's what I tell myself
To get through today
But what tomorrow brings
Will leave me lost and cold again

It's what you put me through
You see I hate myself for you
For what you always put me through
I'd live this life again for you
So what else is new
I'd never love you the next time, you know how it starts
If this wasn't the last step, take me down at 3 am}
Every time I think of you it hurts to know you're right
But then I laugh to think how it could have been
If I played by your rules 
And wondered all through school

Hazy Moon 
What do you do when your life has become
the calm before the storm
when it leaves you feeling numb.
Then you try to find the answers
with only one question,
Where did the stars go?
What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon
Why is it we find peace, in looking up at the sky
the clouds, the stars, the moon
will always try and pass us by
but we have to remember
to not float up there together
when what's important is down below, looking right back up at it...
What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon
Trees will always fall, branches sometimes break
but here is where we'll be safe
sittin' on the deck we made.

Hope Is Over Rated 
The moon is rising now 
I can see it from a distance 
it comes up as i fall down 
reminds me of useless persistence then i look back 
and recall that time for that moment 
i truly believed you'd be mine 
maybe it was never meant to be 
but those few minutes were precious to me
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
I've said my prayers wished upon a star and nothing has come of this so far 
simply stated I'm here but you're there and nothing more will come of this today 
why were the times with you such bliss 
why did i have to reach for a kiss 
can i ask what i did wrong 
no answers as thoughts play through my head
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
Never thought it was doomed to fail 
it was acted well when it seemed that you cared 
alone on the beach as i stare along the shore without you is so bare 
why were the times with you such bliss 
why did i have to reach for a kiss 
can i ask what i did wrong 
no answers and thoughts play through my head
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
Relationships are gone like the sky 
the stars said good-bye and now the turn is mine 
now if you wont tell me why I'll know that it's a lie 
nothing is ever fine 
you're love was just a dark disguise 
the one that I despise 
its funny how time flies 
you'll always be just a girl who denies the fact she cries....

If You Only Knew (acoustic) 
Speaking is something, rather than nothing. Cooling nights with moonless beaches under our skies. Everything that can't be seen by anything less than gracious eyes. That certain something that shines out of you. Comes shining out of you.
If you knew. If you knew. What you do... All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because  trying is worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
If you only knew... how many times I goto sleep with you in my mind. If you only knew... how much I need to hear your voice. If you only knew... how I wish I could touch you, forever in time. Problem's solved, out of touch but never out of time.
Did you know? Did you know? That this song was just a crutch, and the fear is over. All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because trying's worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
Phone is ringing today louder and louder. (Phone is ringing) Life passed by yesterday like clouds unnoticed. (Life passed by) Heart beating faster tonight can't stand sleeping. (Heart beating faster) You smiling again in the corner of my eye, that look you gave me. (You smiling again)
Remember when we used to play out in the rain? Times were simpler than, but even if hard times lie ahead. Follow this song, if you only knew. If you only knew. if you only knew...............

Just Wait 
Sometimes in dreams
you seem so far away
but then there you are
smiling back like any other day
This could be crazy
but hey let's take a chance
what is there to lose
besides our hopes and the last dance
(1st) You just gotta let it come to you
hold it all in
wait till that precious moment
where it means more in the end
(2nd) Just wait
it will all come in time
Just wait
hold it all inside
Just wait
for what we feel right now
will prove to be great so
Just wait
till I can how you what I mean
You can't plan it out 
just be yourself
cause you know who you are
and it's better than everyone else
You can't tell me this ain't real
cause all i'm feeling is true
it isn't falling together now
but maybe soon

Knew But Now Know 
You left us
While I'm struggling with all our insecurities
and when the lights go out do you think of me
ten days will pass and then I'll start to breath again
because without you there's no me 
and evenknow you never went, part of me left
C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01
I hate the months that start without you
and please believe me if only once, I could tell you
your voice helps, it helps me get through the day
and what I needed to feel, I finally figured out
Now after sunrise it's your favorite day, (Thursday)
just do it one more time, please for me...ring, ring, ring
C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01
What if you only knew and someday were put together for us
then maybe you would realize what I'm talking about
and see that the truth between us can make a stone bleed
but if it got on you no matter what it would be my fault (my fault)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Forgive me, I'm sorry
Just feel me, looking through you (6x)

Last Words 
As you leave me here
my heart tears inside
I can't stop you now
your walking down that line
with your head strait down
looking to your feet 
not looking back
for there's no words left to speak
You said I made myself
special without words
but how can that be true
when you give up
wow my heart would stop for you
Oh there are a million ways
to say "oh please stay"
but you'd still walk away
Somehow i feel left out 
not apart of your life
At least it is what you want
damn how it hurts inside
if I could only tell 
Sure I thought I knew you well 
Please tell me I am wrong
These are my Last words
that shall never speak
Repeat 1st verse..

Magic Happy Bouncy Ball 
A plane flies overhead

My fav'rite girl

Says what she wants 
When she's with me 
Well she's so smart 
And is her hair soft! 
And where she is 
That's where I'll be 
When she gets up in the morning 
And she turns open the blinds 
I tell her I like her t-shirt 
Then she says thanks because she is so kind 
One time we went to a movie 
One time we went to a show 
She is my friend and i love her 
Even when her parents tell me to go

My Left Handed Gun 
You made me cry today
from now on i'll never be the same
something clicked 
and made me see that you are just like the rest
not worth the chance
I'll now take what I get
and not take a second glance
(Chorus)
you want to give up 
you already have 
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body 
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry 
for the damn world has won
It's such strong shit
I must speak in song
cause you don't understand
my spoken words
you don't want to listen
i'm worth it 
i'm only human
why the hell
does he come to see me
you don't even try 
nonnooooo
(Chorus)
you want to give up 
you already have 
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body 
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry 
for the damn world has won
my left handed gun
my left handed gun
it wants to show you 
can it show you

Sleep, sleep, sleep keep sleeping

Never Leave 
tell me that you'll never leave, cuz you know I'm lost alone,
tell me that you'll never go, cuz you're breakin my heart, 
don't leave don't go. 
cuz everything is better with you than without you,
and anything is better than on my own again.
sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance, 
but just a second guess and it's to late, 
so many broken hearts along the way, 
another empty promise every day
do you care will it bother you, 
enough to make you stop and think, 
about the stupid things you say,
the lie's you tell and the game's you play
sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance, 
but just a second guess and it's to late, 
so many broken hearts along the way, 
another empty promise every day
i thought we'd last, until the end of time 
but know i see the truth in your eye's, and it breaks my heart, 
i'd rather die than to see that look in your eye's, in your eye's

Boy: "Hey, so what are you doing tonight?"
Girl: "Guess..."
Boy: "Really? Again?"
Girl: "Yea, it's what I do best"
Boy: "Always knew that"
Girl: "But always doubted..."
Can't you shoot me now, together I'm so lonely
Barred from you somehow, smooth until we fight...
ourselves... from killing this away from myself again
you're the queen of this panic and I'm due for punishment
so send your royal aggravations to sting me again
Boy: "If you fell, who would catch you?"
Girl: "Probably no one"
Boy: "I would, I'll never stop catching you"
Girl: "Why? All I do is cause you pain"
Boy: "Come here, feel what I feel"
Girl: "I'm scared"
Take this light, venture out into the world
you fell into night, so what if I need you sleeping
Just like always, sometimes least expectations are the plan
swallow my dreams, take the gun out of your left hand
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
Boy: "Hey, you still with me?"

October Skies 
Oh yea ya know it's true
it started out with you
at first we couldn't show
eachother what we know
All these things we see
so special, they could be
(Chorus)
So paint your signs up on my walls 
walking lonely down your halls
dim lights fade
but things will be just fine
'cause the sun sets in your eyes
underneath these October skies 
Lonely stares up at the moon
and you know what's killing me
your lips, your eyes
oh yea I need you soon

Waiting for this to be
while I make this one a memory
as I push down the gas 
and I'm goin' real fast
it all fades away

One Moment Caught In Time 
Soaking my head once again
to drown my fears until you said,
("Down the line but never crossed")
These silly games that we pretend
Another ocean made of friends
The harder we want to fall
the long we'll keep this going
I want, but can't see at all
our truth will just keep showing
The mirror
on the wall
me standing 
in front of it
and you're there
behind me
so softly
whispering this
and than we
could see
how great face 
to face could be
it could be......
One moment caught in time
is not enough 
to hold you here with me
in my mind
and in my life

Perfect 
I look at you there 
Oh, I wish I could stare 
And if I could I just would say 
That you're the reason I woke up today
Cuz now I know that you're the one for me 
Yeah, even if you don't know it just yet 
And now I know that you're the one for me 
Yeah, even if I can't show it just yet
I can see that you don't know 
Is it worth all my trying for you? 
If I could, I just would show 
That I'm all alone dying, 
waitin' and 
tryin' for you...
But you're perfect 
Yeah you're perfect 
But you're perfect 
You're too perfect
So perfect......
Distinction, rejection, affection... ahhh it's these things that make me true...
Devotion, compassion, perfection... ohhh it's the things that I see in you...

I'm begging' you please, just wait a little more

No one's to blame, but the time will come.

Pick Up My Ashes (Angels And Devils) 
Didn't you pretend to fall in love
and now the crisis is you're getting sick of me
Take this opener and stab 
through the letters of words I can't show you
me always asking myself 
Why don't you wanna see me tonight?
If I could only steal the sun and throw it at you
maybe then you will see the light
(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't happen
Your words are a fire that's burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why don't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound
So what if I want you
is it a sin to try and love you
forget taking what you get, in your heart you know the truth
and not having what you want should be killing you
So what if I need you
is it a sin to make you feel like you have never felt before
Just give this chance and take this touch
Feel this now and when it works you will know 
that avoiding me is not the answer, us... together is better 
nothing will ever come close
(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't ever happen
Your words are flames that are burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why won't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound
When you hold my face
my fingers through your hair
and then I'll always say I'll be there
with your warmth through cold
whisper to me
hold me tight, come on baby
and we all know something
tonight, tonight
just as long as we're outside
connection's made, one gazing stare
tonight's forever don't be scared
(2nd Chorus)
I know, I know-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah
that you know, what we both know
and we now see, what we both know
angels... devils...
your angels

you fly me, fly me, fly me away
fly me away
please fly me 
fly me away

Poor You For Listening 
You 
You never were much fun 
You made me hide my eyes 
You hit me like the sun 
A life built on routine has replaced that of surprise 
And I've been feeling better since I turned away my eyes 
Ever since you left me, I felt like I was new 
And I haven't got much else to say to you 
Poor me 
Stick around and you will see 
Poor me 
Poor you for listening
All I ever want is morning 
All I ever get is night 
All I ever want is boring 
All I ever get is fright 
All I ever want is the doctor's office lollipop 
All I ever get is the tetanus shot 
All I ever want is the feeling that I'm over you 
All I ever get is not 
I 
I want an empty world 
I never had a friend 
I never had a girl 
All these things I've never had before, now I've got in spades 
And hearts, and clubs, and diamonds for fifty-two straight days 
As I step up to the table, I find I'm unprepared 
All I got is poker, all I want is solitaire
Now 
Now that we're apart 
The party never stops 
The boredom never starts 
I haven't time to breathe now, that's why my face is red 
As rings, and tones, and busy signals bounce about my head 
Savoring what's left of sleep as I am forced to rise 
And figuring I'm not missing much, fall back and close my eyes

Popular And Up A Tree 
There's no beginning to this song
There's no beginning to this song
I wish you stayed and now I'm going on
Yea, no beginning to this song
20 questions come and go 
true colors always show
but your just hurting them -
oh wait your hurting me (Grab my arm tighter)
I don't wanna move forward, I don't wanna move back
just stick in this single place in time
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....
Take a step outside yourself it's cold
imperfection's just a stage
so play it over again now and see
what I could be, if I wanted to be
popular and up a tree
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....
It's funny all I wanna hear
is bottomlines fly through my ears
and when there's nothing left to fear
there's bottomlines that end in tears
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
that end in tears
take cover

Red Light Before Regret 
Don't you waste another thought on me, please
wind blowing right through my fingers
and your eyes pierce when you look at me
I can't lie anymore
or hide this inside
you're so cold to me
and I'll always be colder than you are
Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself
Tear up my songs 
I really hate them, anything I have done
they could never tell anything
so just burn them
I never made you smile
I always bring you down
you know you'd be happier (so much happier)
with him
Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself
The music makes me die
staring at space through a car stereo
does nothing mean anything
just stop me,
just stop me before I make you cry
make you cry (4x)

Sleepy Eyes 
Diving in head first
is what you make me wanna do
Counting down the hours and minutes with you
When all is said and done
cause I want more and I need you
Phone was ringing, the phone is ringing
but now it's not (now it's not)
(Chorus)
I could never take (you in the place)
to take or ever face (wait wait I need you I need you)
you and I can't replace (Things will work out)2x
and you could never fake (These feelings feelings)
Things will work out (they will they will)
Things will work out (look in my eyes)
Once we can't run we will hide
Another dream last night
where we drove out to a beach
dive right in
and made-out under the stars
why can't you see
that bridges fall for me
and the scars on my back (remind me)
Sleepy eyes, look at me
sleepy eyes, c'mon 
look at me
Sleepy Eyes, look at me
You will see
Love inside of me until I die
fill up my sleepy eyes

Staring Right Back 
You know what I think
I think I'm gonna sink
sinking in your sun
I'll float up when I'm done
And when everything
all comes back to me
I'll still be right here
sinking in your sea
But maybe....
bombs could drop
then there's cops
I never want to go
but I can't have it stop
In due time is nothing 
but the middle is something
only not the top
(Chorus)
And I'll be there
to get in your face
when nothing seems to be there
and I'm there
to step in your way
when life ain't fair
You know this is not the way
lookin' right in front of you
hate the flavor, but love the taste
staring right back, right back
right back, right back
right back, right back
staring right back out at you

Steal My Flashlight 
Left alone and lost in the dark again
you steal my flashlight every chance you get
Once fallen memories when I lost your eyes, but now the candle's lit
Every day the same way (the same way) Please don't change (don't ever change)
Stop, rewind the tape -
play it back for me
all the things you ever said (all those things you ever said)
we're falling down on me
Stop, go back - 
and play it for me (please)
say some more
all the things saving me (saving me)
It's always night
when I look down empty streets
Where is the light
it's in you right in front of me
It's dark, I'm scared (Don't be a waste if you promise me)
It's dark, I'm scared (what do I do, what do I do)
Why steal the light that you put right back into
my light....
you put it right back into me

The Clock At Midnight 
The ticking gets louder
as it racks up with distance
but as you speak it goes faint
for you bring me out of reality
and into a dream
Hurt its my heart
when i must tell you its late
for now the clock is staring into me
i turn away 
never do i want to leave this place
for we created it 
you and me
It's hard to say good-bye
when all i want to do is talk all night
and fall away into a deep dream
Words are hard to speak 
it's midnight
all means so much
we could think of a million things 
but the time ticks on
The past goes ticking away
futher away in time
it grows fainter
into a dull whisper
you amaze me 
with you words
and the sound of your voice
i could listen forever
if it was my choice
how could i ever part
for the ticking goes on
along with the beating of my heart
which beats for you
and louder with every step.
I could talk all night
but it's midnight

The Five Alive Song 
I drink my Five Alive real slow 
Out of a striped blue bendy straw 
I like my Five Alive real cold 
And leave some time to let it thaw 
I've tried a lot of other drinks 
But nothing seemed to do the trick 
No juice could beat my Five Alive 
Unreal assorted fruit juice mix 
The other day I was at school 
Sipping my Five Alive, looking cool 
Bumped into you and spilled my juice 
All over you, felt like a fool 
But you just looked at me and smiled, 
"Hey baby, I like your style" 
You like Five Alive, and I like you 
You like Five Alive, and you're cool 
I like Five Alive, and you like me 
I want to have some after school with you 
You drink so fast it makes me sick 
You're my Five Alive sidekick 
Every day you cheer me up 
With Five Alive in a plastic cup 
You're my juiced-up sugarbaby 
If you asked me now, I might say maybe 
I want you to be 
My Five Alive lady 
Christmastime is coming 
Get your Five Alive 
It's gonna go fast so 
Don't be left behind 
La la la la la la la

The Princess And The Toad 
Could you ever wish upon the stars
and make them all come true
Ever really feel love surrounded in my arms?
my favorite color is blue
I sit, I'm longing and thinking am I sinking
in you?
and if I was, would it be bad?
if I wanted to, would you let me?
I felt I always held you back
oh why did God make you so sexy
(Chorus)
I'm wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself 
to someday happen
and actually last
Two heads
pulling me in both directions
everytime I see 
your face
and it's staring back at me (staring back at me)
I'll always be
(Chorus)
wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself 
to someday happen
and actually last
just last
promise me they'll last
In dreams I am happy
but my outlook is haunted with reality
Sweetpea do you want this?
baby do you want me?
no words, just show me
just nod yes or no
Cause you'll always be a princess and I'll always be the toad

Thursday Was Your Favorite Day 
Do you know, where everyone will go
if tomorrow always comes so slow
Look at me, look deep into my eyes
knowing everything is just alright
Things I like, things you do to me
make you know fine is the way they'll always be
Because, I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?
It was April but now it's May...
and Thursday was your favorite day...
Can you remember talkin' on the phone
everything about you feels like home
Wondering what to say next
cause I'll meet you on the steps
and see your pretty face
waiting in our special place
I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?

stop 
things will happen 
I can show you 
I can show you 
ecstasy
Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see
Sneak out 
and see me now 
you will know now 
that with me 
bad is the best thing you can be 
Fly away 
and get the hell out of here 
they gave up 
we're to strong for them 
so there's nothing there to stop us anymore 
hello goodbye 
nothing but eye to eye 
rumors of the hurt and lies 
Giving it up 
is not what makes me feel to free 
I'll never ever 
never ever 
never ever 
never ever 
no.........
Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see
just you and me
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
My heart can't stop 
It's racing all night 
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
I'm trying, I'm feeling you 
although it's not right 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
Goodnight I love you 
I love you goodnight 
nothing tells this feeling 
this feeling inside 
together is better 
you make me feel alive 
together, nothing's better 
shhh turn out the lights 
Goodnight I love you 
I love you goodnight

Unlocking The Secrets Of The Summer Night 
Running into doors, unlocked memories
covered by the night
With no light left to see or wasted life to be
When it's over it's over, it's not and you care, the same
things not said to you. I fear, don't blame
things you never heard before, never said but always meant
Every word, Every night. Every word, Every night
(Chorus)
Spirits around us fly
smoke from the fire calling us
to be nothing more than we were never before
Unlocking the secrets of the summer night
If we ran fast enough, would we beat destiny
I can see you now, on the beach with the sun
I can see you now, in the water making 
choices made but never done
when you smile back at summer's love
and cry......and cry...... and cry......
The tears are showing and days are wasted
not unknowing but always tasted
(Chorus)
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
Dreams are real - ending now
Softly speaking
no sound

Unpublished Song 
Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer
or do you fight to hold the key
but when no one's praying for you
I am out looking for escapes
or ways
away
(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying, 
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying
I can hear you
Just scream louder
I can hear you
a little closer
fight your way
fight the step that's blocking you
(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying, 
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying
Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer
Cheat me down now

Weakness 
Well hey it's stupid, it's dumb
What else can I say
No I'm not
hiding what I really wanna say
Day in Day out
you really got me wondering
where we're going
and if it's our destination
(Chorus)
If i'm not saying what I really wanna say
you never know cause it might come out on any given day
For when I talk or look at you
my head takes a spin
Cause all I want is you
and it's my only weakness
For some reason 
I'm hiding around the corner
won't you come
looking a little farther
Sometimes it's hard
but we're only human
So let's stop
and think about what we're really doing
(Chorus) 2x

When Waves Hide 
Hey...
Remember when we snuck away
so we could be alone
On the sand when I wish you stayed
feels like home
yea...
and nobody, nobody, no one
could compare to your touch
it's all i've ever been wanting
like our every second was fading
I'd break the clock if time would stop
Last night driving home
past a beach I know
11:18... you, all you
11:18 I need you....
We could stand there forever
Music surrounding us
no sound that we can hear
but it's there, but it's there
just listen...
(talking)
I know, I....
still can't believe this
I know, I....
feel it when I hold you
hey, hey 
they're there
they know we're here
shhhhhh
just....
just crash

Your Back Pocket 
The calendar is finished
subtract one month then add one to it
and watch our new beginnings
one month away
with sixteen candles floating
If you'll just stay and shut them out
you will finally know all you want 
and again know me
(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you this song is lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket
All along knew I had what I couldn't go without 
All along knew I had what I couldn't go without 
I'll follow one page of worsts with your best yet
I'll follow one page of worsts and make your best yet
All along knew I had what I couldn't live without 
(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you I am lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket
And from notebooks to sneak-out nights
dreams of freedom week in your back pocket

All Cried Out 
[Allure]
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling 
Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure, 
My heart never knew such pain
(And you) You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you.
[112]
Cryin' over you, yeah
Never wanted to see things your way,
Had to go astray
For why was I such a fool  (Why was I such a fool)
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong?
[Allure]
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames,
Why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected  (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected
(I) I gave you all of me  (Gave you all of me)
How was I to know,
You would weaken so easily
(I) I don't know what to do  (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out  (All cried out)
Over you
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure,
My heart never knew such pain
And you
[112]
You left me so confused

Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

An escalade, a Porsche
And a house on a hill
A platinum watch
Platinum rings
Platinum cards
A condo in Beverly Hills
And they say that
You're a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'Cause I just want
For you to see that

To match ya boots
Versace wear, Chanel

Sexy eyes, sexy lips
Sexy feet, you got
Sex appeal

Wear your hair
The way you dress
And girl the way you
Make me feel
Makes me want
You more and more
You're everything
I'm lookin' for
And I just need for you
To see that
All I want is you
Baby I love your personality

A woman should be
Like picture out of a magazine
Or a vision from

Makes me want you

You're everything

And I just need for you
To see that all
I really want is you

Here we are all alone                                                      
You and me, 
Privacy                                                           
And we can do anything                                                        
Your fantasy                                                                  
I wanna make your dreams come true                                            
Can you hear?

Between your legs Loud and clear

[Chorus:]
We can make love on the bedroom floor                                     
Then on top of my waterbed 
I'm kissing you                                    
Running my fingers through your hair                                          
In the hallway 
Making love away beside the stairs                             
We can do it anywhere...                                                         
I can love you in the shower 
Both of our bodies dripping wet                  
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget                             
On the kitchen floor 
As I softly pull your hair                               
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...
I love the way your body feels                                                
On top of mine so take your  time                                             
We got a night                                                                
Girl, you know I like it slow                                                 
And I know you like it too, baby                                              
Please don't stop I feel it now

Ooh, you put me close to you

Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy thinkin' much
Roll a Dutch, 
Let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I pump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true playa's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cuz I'm hot now
You got me goin', 
I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feenin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way the ghetto way
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday

[Chorus:]
Baby you can come see me,
Cuz I need you here with me,
And I'll show you what love is made of...
Later on if you are free,
Baby you can come see me,
And I'll show you what love is made of...

And I'm sitting here thinking of
How it felt when we first made love,
Oh I need that feeling again,
Nobody can compare, so...

And I'll go with you,
To this place that lovers dream of,
We can do anything, 
Sexy things,
And I'm here to let you know...

Thinking about the last time I held you,
And the smell of your sweet perfume, babe

To this place that lovers dream of,

How many things we can do, 
How many women in my life 
But yet I only love you, 
You're number one on my list, 
And I,

And girlfriend,

Damn, why did you give me space?
At a time when that girl was trying to holla ohh

Why'd did you have to stay?
Why was it too late for us?
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
Baby I should let it go
Or should I let her know
I got another on the side and she does everything right
I dont know what else to do, I'm not happy with you

And i dont ever want her ever to stop cause I love her so much

Do What You Gotta Do 
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
I was always on the phone in the bathroom
You were always in the kitchen at the sink
Girl I was always tryna find a way to tell you
I'm havin' relations and it's gettin' kinda deep
Now even though we've been together for a long time
Girl you know and I know things are not the same
Before we go on any longer wasting all this time
I gotta let you know I'm bout to make a change I'm...
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
You were always in the bedroom watchin' tv
I was always downstairs on the couch
While you were always undecided on a movie
I was always tryna get up out this house
And then I noticed how you always went to sleep
When it was 
time for you 
to give that a** to me
And then you wonder why a brotha wants to creep
Well it's time to let you know I got someone who feels me
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
Something's goin' on 
Something's goin' on where did we go wrong
What happened to the love I used to get at home
You be on my mind used to be my dime
Used to spend time talkin' on the phone
But now that things have changed 
I'm jumpin' in my range
And rollin' out
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do

Everyday 
Everyday
Yah
Oh Oh, Everyday
This is the real right here
Things aint always what they seem
Check it
People look at us 
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what comes along with it
With all the fame and the fortune there's still bull
Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators
Cause they don't 
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal aint a good record deal
But I'm a grown man so I didnt cry about it
Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer use to say
But I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday
Yah
[Chorus]
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing
People wanna know 
What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
Are their records gonna sell
They say that he gave us the hits
Knowin damn well that we write our own sh
It's not that Im mad about it
But I gotta clear it up 
for those wonderin about it
I think you need to read the credits
Open up the cd dog and read the credits
Cause things aint always what they seem
So don't believe everything you see on t.v.
In the videos, I was in a Bentley
And that Bentley in it, belonged, to me
My earrings had to be at least 5 karrots
I had to live up to that superstar status
Stayed on the road
Had to stay doin shows
Even though I'm goin broke
I couldn't let nobody know
[Chorus]
People look at us and say 
How does it feel
On a new label
With a multi million dollar deal
I'm just glad we stayed together
We put our faith in the lord 
And he made things better
Cause he said it in his word
That one day your gonna get
What ya'll deserve
Wow
Now aren't ya glad we stayed together
Through the good and the bad times
We stayed together
Through the rich and the broke times
Through stormy weather
Andhey
Now we look back like
Don't you remember 
when you couldn't afford that boy
Hey
Sunroof top
Chillin by sea 
With a down south female
Like hey
How ya love that
24 inch rims
Big body Cadillac
Andhey
We do it like that
[Chorus]
Oh, ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
True friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever

Living my life without you
Something I don't wanna do
So please don't walk away
And leave me all alone
Baby, stay for just a while
[Chorus:]
Why can't you stay with me
For just a while
Cuz if you leave
You'll take a piece of me
Why can't you stay
With me for just a while
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart
[112]
Oh baby, girl I don't want you to go
You are my heart and soul
The reason that I live
The one that I adore
And I can't stand the thought
Of being by myself
But I can't see myself
Loving no, nobody else

And when ever you need me girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll always love you
Who can love you
Why won't you stay with me awhile

Oh baby,

Got the funny feeling,

Everytime I try to kiss your lips, you turn away.

And I try to be strong, but I feel like you dont love me, 
Anymore...
[Chorus:]
Funny feelings,
Funny feelings,
That you don't love me anymore.

Waiting for it to ring.

But from you I never recieve a thing.
Well I try, to just go
By the things that you say.
But the things that you do,
They just tell me that you dont love me, 
Anymore...

Oh baby...

God Knows 
[Verse 1:]
Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you'll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
[Verse 2:]
Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you're so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand just how I feel for you
You're the one that I cant let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus (2x):]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And everytime I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause everytime you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, only God knows
[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows

Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can break in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb til we reach the peak
The technique will make u sweat 
But don't sweat the technique

I Can't Believe 
(feat. Faith Evans)
[Chorus:]
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you've gone away)
[112]
Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me
[Faith]
Lord, let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
Cuz I don't wanna be hurt like this again
I can't believe
[Chorus]
[112]
Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind and things could have changed
I'll give anything to be with you again
[112]
All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way
I can't believe you've gone away
[Chorus]
[112]
When I look back on the times we've shared
Our life was ok, now what else could come down
[Faith]
Don't you know you were my love (my only love)
And I can't believe that you've gone away

You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know
[Chorus]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigger riding up with that drama

There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit
[Verse 2]
Say it, don't flinch, let me shirt this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you wanna front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you started grabbing it
I already know how to handle you
Can do you
Before I put the hands on you
I'm a beat that thing
Like your man should do
But I don't want a repercussion when we do
[Hook]
When you stick, when we split ain't no hits

'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit
[Rap: T.I.]
The grey goose make you wanna get loose
Got your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe
'Cause the rims same colour as the ride and the roof
Or maybe cause your friend wanna ride with me too
Maybe it's the way a nigger shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like ro or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cufflinks like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell 'em once I handle business like a G
You're running with the boldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
We should have an understanding
[Chorus]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigger riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

What is this?
Numbers in your pocket
I remember when you
Used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason?
To act so shady
Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
Ooh, that's how much I care for you
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool
Yes I don't understand baby yeah

 - Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk
Girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought
We'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now
It's over now
You think that I don't know what's going on
Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messing around baby
Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you baby
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool

[Repeat 1 (2x)]
Baby it's a shame
A shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me
And I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh baby it's a shame

Forgot what love was all about
And the feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you, oh
Girl it's over

So baby hold on

Just a little while
Just a little while longer
Just a little while
I'm coming back to you
In a little while
For a little while longer
In a little while
I'm coming back
A thousand wasted tears
Our love's been strong for years
Your cry is not in vain
Cuz I understand
I'm trying to be the man
You loved when we began
Your cry is not alone
I'm crying too
You gotta hold on
[Chorus]
If only you knew my love
You wouldm't feel this way

Last To Know 
[verse 1]
Lately I have been questioning if what we have is lost 
I heard it in your voice when we were fighting
Tell me where it's gone?
Girl I thought that we could talk about whatever
Any problem that we had we'd always work it together
Did I say or is there something I've done wrong
Baby I should know, but I don't, still I wanna make it better
[chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know
[verse 2]
Honestly you got me torn and I'm so confused
Cause nowadays you got a new attitude
And you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through
You rush of the line like I don't matter to you
Was it something I said, girl what did I do
If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out
There's no difference from what we've been through before
I can't move on and I won't until we make it better
[chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know
[bridge]
I never believed we go this far
Don't you let people tell what we have past

Girl I don't understand, stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't wanna see, wanna see you leave
Wanna let you go, I just wanna find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologised tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go
[Chorus x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go
[Verse 2]
Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go
[Chorus x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go

And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong

Oh Babe

My My Sweet Babe
[Repeat 2X]

A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]
[Verse 2]
A man is imperative
In the world we live
He's a father to his children
And the head of a nation
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a provider
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]
[Bridge]
Now tell me who's the King of his castle
And tell me who wears the pants around here
Whos a father to his children
A man like me
Now who would be the queen of the castle
Sitting beside you through the thick and the thin
She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth
Even though she living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" " Yeah" Yeah"]
[Chorus 1]
Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe

Missing You 
Sitting here thinking about you 
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo
Sitting here wondering where we 
Wonderin where we went wrong 
Cause now I'm here all alone
Wishing you'd come back home, So tell me 
Why, why, why'd you have to go away 
Got me missing you everyday
Baby tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away 
Got me missing you everyday
Everyday I'm missing you 
I don't understand why you left, baby what didn't I do?
Wasn't I always there for you and wasn't I good to you?
How was I to know something was wrong, 
Baby I can't read minds
All you had to do was tell me
But you kept it all inside 
Tell me why, why, why'd you  have to go away got me missing you everyday
Baby, tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday

Girl I'll never find another, 
Another one to take your place
Cause you were so, so good to me baby 
And you kept the smile upon my face
And I'm on my bended knee and I'm crying, crying won't you come back to me
To me cause you mean the world to me
Why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday

My Mistakes 
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Verse 1]
Whats wrong with me
Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical 
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth
Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Not thinking of me and you
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Verse 2]
As bad as I
Want you right here
I empathize with the way that you feel
Took away the thing
That you call your cute
If you could find the feeling you have from the start
You know we should never be apart
I'm asking you can you please listen to me
When you took me back before
I promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Without thinking of me and you
[2x Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Bridge]
When they want you
come over and talk to me
I know I don't deserve to be a part
Of anyone tryna give me the heart
They loving me
Baby please
Come on over and talk to me
I see you like you've never seen him before
Cuz you're the only one to show me the love
[Repeat Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

Never mind that he don't care

Say it's alright and I'll be there

Shoulda never let him call you, baby
No matter how I try
No longer can I hide

Nowhere 
If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I aint never,
Lemme say that again,
I aint never, goin nowhere
Listen to me
Last night I allmost cried when you told me 
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that i've got for you
Im telling you
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere
I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
Untill I found you and you made it 
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you dont know the half of it
But baby heres the rest of it
Did you know that  your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and im the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby thats for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere

Now That We're Done 
Got to try my best to reach the lowest low
To a place where no one goes
If you let me taste your soul
I'd let you taste my funky emotions
And I'll cover you with me
In a pool of ecstasy
There's no place I'd rather be
Then with you
Please let me do you again
[Chorus:]
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
You touch me there, what are you thinkin', ooh
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
Here comes the sun, now what are you thinkin', ooh
Lying here on a bed full of trust
Just don't fully cover the lust
Anticipating on the questions I'll ask
Was I strong enough or will I last, I don't know
It's kinda hard to play this right
These feelings that I have inside
Is something that I just can't, can't hide
[Chorus 2x]
Do it again
Can't believe how this feels
The feeling is unreal
I got to know now that we're done
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Can we do it again and again and again and agian
112 won't you help me sing it

Palm trees, 
Cats lay in Pablo,
In milked out diablos, 
The Williest, 
Bitches be the silliest, 
The more I smoke, 
The smaller the phillie gets, 
Room 112 where the players dwell, 
To stash more cash than Burn and Hale, 
Inhale, 
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (feels good), 
Dig up in your middle like Monie (yeah), 
Don't know me,
But your settin up to blow me, 
Try to style, 
Fly up north with a homie (yes),
It's style is dondatta, 
Playas stay splurgin',
Game so tight,
They call it virgin...
[112]
Oh I need to know,
Where we stand,
Do we share this special thing called love,
I know I do, 
What about you,
I just can't get enough of the time...
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
[Chorus:]
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else, 
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life...
Every time I'm with you,
Never want it to come to an end (thought I told you that we won't stop),
You always make me so happy,
You'll always have a place in my heart...
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
[Mase]
Now you can hum all you want to, 
Cum all you want to, 
Money I'mma front you, 
Girl I wanna flaunt you, 
I'mma always want you, 
When nobody want you, 
If I die now my love will still haunt you, 
Mase ain't the one that will pay for your phone, 
Mase be the one that will take you home,
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone, 
All your nights alone,
I could make you moan, 
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce, 
Bad Boy get more money than you can count, 
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce, 
I'd do it to your cat for a large amount,
And when the beef come you know where to be found, 
Why I be around till the winner is announced (the winner is), 
So there ya go girl with thousands in ya palms,
Why you can't let by gones be by gones...

Where do I go,
What must I do,
If I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby,

Player 
I'm a player..... girl I thought you knew
When you started messin around with me, knew I wouldn't commit to you
Cause I'm a player...... and I know you can't see it in my eyes......
Everyone says that I'm innocent, and it should come as no surprise....
That I'm a player........... and I really think you need to know
That I can't love you right now baby, 'cause I need more time to grow.......
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... when I do get ready to settle down,
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
But until then.........
I'm a player, and I've traveled all around the world,
I've broken many hearts, and it really hurts to say this to you girl
But I'm a player........ and it's kinda sad that it has to be this way,
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready, so right now, I'm gonna play......
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... when I do get ready to settle down,

But until then.........

Pleasure And Pain 
You always said you loved me
Though my mind's right now not sure
You've always been there for me
Though my heart never feels secure
Why can't you take a further step
To let me know you really care
Cuz now I'm feeling driven
Into a love that's not right there
[Chorus:]
Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain
After all I've said
You still have it set in your head
That you don't really care about me
Why can't you seem to believe
That I'm the only one for you
I gave all my love to you
And after all I've done for you
You never say that you love me
The way that I love you
[Chorus]
I feel all the pain, hurt so bad, feel so sad
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad
I just can't take no more baby
Girl make a change
So I can feel the pleasure and not the pain

Just give me one chance
To prove to you I'm a better man
Never break apart
You'll always be in my heart
Whatever he won't do
You know I'd do it for you
[Chorus]
I'll do things for you
Like that man won't do
I'll prove my love to you
Girl I'll die for you
I'll hold you tight
All through the night
To let you know
It'll be alright
You are my world
Please be my girl
I promise you
My love is true
I'll make love to you
I'll take care of you
Girl I'm gonna show you that Im
Right here for you
[Chorus X2]
Oh Baby
Be Right There for You

Say Yes 
[Verse 1]
Girl you had my attention
From the first time
I laid eyes on you
And ever since that moment
I wanted to be
Be the one for you
And I know its hard
'cause you've been scarred
But baby let me heal that wound
And I know that you've heard
All this before
But there's a different man
At your door
[Chorus:]
Why don't we just run away
We can take a trip, leave today
All I need is for you to just
Say yes
You don't have to bring a thing
Don't worry 'bout that
It's all on me
All I need is for you to just
Say yes
[Verse 2]
Might be crazy but I know that
You want it just as bad
Now you've finally got a reason
To leave that pain in the past
'cause we can
Go wherever you want to
Do whatever you like
Ooh let me show you babe
The kind of real man
That you been missing
[Chorus 2x]
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
This is what I need from you
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Slip Away 
Baby
I wish you had recognized
The love I had for you
When it was in my heart
And when it was there for you
Because now
You're coming back to me
And you recognize the love that was once there
But I found somebody else
It's too lateIm sorry
You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
Should have allowed yourself to 
Believe in love, and recognize
That my love, it wasn't going nowhere
Noone but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would push your love aside
Baby
[Chorus]
It's too bad
You missed out on me 
And it's so sad
Sad that you're gone away
And I'm sorry
That you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let my love slip away
And you should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
Should have allowed yourself to be adult, instead of a child
But you are the one with insecurities
You tried to put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay
And now it is
[Chorus]
Baby tell me how
Baby how could you
Let our, love, fade away
But you never knew 
I cared for you, and that I loved you
And you never, gave me
Your everything
This love was not for you
And Baby
[Chorus x2]
You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
So sorry, but you let my love slip away
You should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
So sorry, but

Smile 
Another night and it seems that 
You made you cry yourself to sleep
Reminiscing on how it began
You found pleasure in this man
And you fell like an autumn leaf
for his lies now you wanna leave
Give me just one chance 
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cried
You don't deserve it
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
Tranquillity the misery 
Any day will it ever cease?
Here's my shoulder it's okay to cry
Cause I know how make it right
Cause you feel like you wanna leave
For his life now you won't lead
Baby give me one chance
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it 
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
Whoaa

Someone To Hold 
Sometimes I stare at the bed
Knowing that no one's there
Something is telling me
That you feel the way I do
I dream of you all the time
Wishing that you were mine
I'm feeling so empty
Hoping you'll think of me
I need ya here tonight
[Chorus:]
If I'm all alone
And you're all alone
Ain't nothing wrong
Having someone to hold
Oh, your tender touch
It means so much
It feels so right having someone to hold
It's very plain to see
I want you next to me
Give me your hand and
I'll try to understand
Girl I love you so
I can't let you go
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold
Every now and then
I get to wondering
Are you with someone else
Or could you be by yourself
I turn on the TV
It's a picture of you and me
And I'm going crazy
Cuz I miss my baby
I want you here tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And everything that you have done for me
No one has ever done before
And I'll never let you go
You mean the world to me
And baby the way you make me feel
Whenever I'm alone with you
Is irreplaceable
(Girl, there ain't nothing wrong so)

That's How Close We Are 
Na na na 
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you aint got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause thats how close we are
Without a sea you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walkin if you aint got the legs
Understand i use them eyes to see
That's how close we are
[chorus]
Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there aint none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
Thats how close we are 
[x2]
Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you dont have no sea
Just look at my life, and its her you'll see
Cause thats how close we are
And without a voice no one can hear you sing
And it ain't no flying without the wings
So if you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are
[chorus]
[breakdown]
She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, shes teaching me
Everything i can't do 
Everything i can't say
She does for me
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands
You can say:
Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
Thats how close we are

The Only One 
(feat. Lil' Kim)
[Lil Kim]
Catch me in the spot, low C's in the drop
About half and ounce, the size of Zip-lock
Knockin' the new One-one-deuce
I wanna (intro)deuce me and my old flame
And his name is Bruce
But blew my eye when his girl drove by
Told me bye then he winked his eye
I'm too Don fo' this, too fly to curse
Threw his jacket out first then BAM! Hit reverse
[112]
Oh, baby
You need to know
I've been in love
And I've never known love like this
I need to know
Just how you feel
Let me know if this love is real
I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
[repeat]
Oh, baby I think it's time for us to grow
We've been friends now for far too long
The way you kiss, it turns me on
Let me know if you feel this strong
[Chorus]
Give me your love
Don't you know that I, I need your love
I need you here in my life, baby (everyday)
Baby, please, I'll take good care
I'll take care of your needs
I need you here with me
[Lil' Kim]
Pretend like we friends
And do our own thing (c'mon)
We can chitty-bang-bang
But let the phone ring (I like this)
From the first night, knew you wasn't true
Ex-girl came through, she said she miss you (uh, huh)
Panties in the bathroom sink, hot pink (hot pink)
What's a girl like me supposed to think? (c'mon)
I'm a Bad Girl (Bad Girl)
You shady? I get shady (shady)
To up your old lady and proposing us to stay still friends

This is the time where you all should report to the dance floor

J.D. plus 112 add that up
Now, that equals me seein' you in see-through
Now, whatever the chain go I let the bottle of three do
Jeans by E-vesal check out the Vs too
A roof free coup do you like what you see boo (You like what you see)

Shawty think she a dime
Me on her mind, sure to be some sexin' goin' on, talkin' reckless on the phone, she be naked waitin' home
Soon as I undress it's on
She be screamin' Jermaine till six in the mornin'
[Verse 1]
Girl I need to see you right away
There's somethin' one my mind about you and I that I gotta say oh baby
Lately we been talkin' on the two way
About what you like about what I like
And I think it's about time we do somethin' about it at home
[Bridge]
It's been so long, since 
You had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot that you love
And baby I'm willin' to give you what you've been missin'
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it

Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you

Baby I freak you

[Verse 2]
I used to want you so bad years ago
No the feelin's come back
Baby infact, it's alittle bit stronger than before
Is it wrong if I touch ya
Where your man didn't touch ya
'Cause he had ya baby
Don't say no baby
Just let me have my way with you
[Bridge]
Been so long since you
Had a man in you life
Weather you know it or not 
You need someone to touch that spot

Tell a ball player dude he can slide on true
Check one, one two, come on
Check one, one two (Once again it's on)
[Chorus to fade: 112 with various ad-libs]

Unbelievable 
This is a DPS production
Give me a beat.

I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Lookin for a girl tonight
Lookin for a perfect per-son-ality
And she gotta have a freaky side
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need
Girl let me be your everything
Baby all that you need and more
Shakin off all this drama in my life
Girl I'm kickin it at the door
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable
[Chorus]
So unbelievable
Your love is incredible
If you're available (girl this is what I need)
Then just let me know
So, So unbelievable
Your love in incredible
If you're available

And you know that I like it slow
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need
Gonna make your dreams come true tonight
Cause baby I'm feelin you
We can do just what you want, just what you like
Cause it's all about me and you
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable
[Chorus X2]
The dambdest thing
I wanna buy you all the finest things
Big house in the hills
Supersize your rings
My mind's on my money 
And my money's on my mind
Get you up out of the ghetto
I just want you to shine
So don't be telling your girls my money dont stretch
And don't be sayin that 112 dont make hits
Cause you know I moved up
>From the 5 to the six
When I shift with the radio
I know they gonna like this
Sayin Def Jam is like sayin no stress man
Tv's and champaign in the stretch Lex man
Pour a glass for yourself and pass it to the next man
Takin trips from Atlanta to the Kamen Islands
Forget your problems, lay back, catch a tan
You know we livin it up, chillin in the sand
Catch me off in the club, spend a couple grand
It's Un-be-live-a-ble
[Chorus X4]

We Goin' Be Alright 
I would walk, I would walk, I would walk
A thousand miles, if I knew that you
Would be waiting on the other side
I would climb, I would climb, I would climb
The highest mountain,
If you would fulfil the promise to be mine oh mine
I would swim, the seven seas
If we could sit down and talk about us
And agree to agree
I would walk without water 
Across the death of sand 
To here you say you're ready to be in love again
People are talking, trying to build us apart
They can't see the love in our hearts
Girl I care about you and you care about me
And if we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, yes we will
We goin' be alright, alright
We goin' be alright, yes we will
If we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, alright!

Whatcha Gonna Do 
(feat. MJG)
You tell me you're keepin' it real with me
You tell me that I'm the only one
You say you'll never leave me lonely, girl
That was a lie
I  never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye
[1]
 - Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known
Listen baby
[2]
 - Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]
Baby, can't you see
I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you
[MJG]
I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten"
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do...

(What if) what if I woke up from this madness and this shit was just a dream
(What if) what if I really went to work and didn't spend a whole day creeping?
(What if) what if you were at the beauty shop and you didn't hear about me last weekend?
(What if) what if you ever asked me a question and I didn't stut-stut-stutter all of the time?
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling, you would stiiiill

Why Can't We Get Along 
[Intro: harmonizing]
[Verse One:]
Is it me,
Who never compromise,
I only see things through my eyes,
Which means is my way?
Or is it you
Who's always shutting down,
Never wanting to talk about the problems we got?
[Pre-Chorus:]
Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not wanna stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves..
[Chorus: 2x]
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?
[Verse Two:]
Tell me
Why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat?
Is it true
That I'm so unreasonable 
And I don't know how to love
Even though God sent to me to you?
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2x]
[Bridge:]
I just can't sit and watch us go at each other this way.
'Cause you know like I know we're better than this.
Girl, I've tried everything in my heart but it's weighing to be more than just your man.
'Cause you deserve the best.
Together we're the best.
We just can't throw it away...
[Chorus 2x]
[Bridge Two:]
'Cause you know I love you, and I know you love me
Can we, can we baby?
Oh, why can't we get along, when we both know that this is home?

Why Does 
All the love you've given me
So special seems to be no limit
I'll do anything
There's no boundries to how we can grow
How can I let you know
Girl, let me sit and think, oh
[Chorus:]
Why does the wind blow
Why does the sun shine
Why does the rain fall down on my face
Why does the earth spin
Why do the waters reach the shore
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do
Oh, in the past
You were there when I was down
My friends could not be found
Your touch kept me so strong
But our love didn't fade away
Instead it sails inside the sky
That's why I must ask why
I must ask why
[Chorus]
I ask myself the question time and time again
(Baby I love you)
Baby I love you
(Yes I do)
Why did you have to hurt me
And leave me all alone
(Baby I love you)
Oh, baby I love you
Now I'm all alone when I need your love

Your Letter 
I saw a letter lying on the floor
I couldn't help but look inside
Thought it was something that you must've left
Left there for me to find
All your words were on that page
All my dreams came true that day
I found
[Chorus:]
Your letter...
Your letter...
It said you loved me
But you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wish someday that I would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I guess it just never occured to me
That you would feel the way I did
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart
You kept those feelings in
Though you never showed a sign
Give a clue to what I'd find
Inside
[Chorus]
I was so happy that I almost cried
To think that you would think of me that way
It's like you took my sweetest dream
And made that dream come true
I would be with you
Always...
I saw a name I didn't recognize
I felt the tears come to my eyes
Seeing that the love that you've been longing for
Was another love, not mine
No, you never showed a sign
But it was right there in the lines
Inside
Your letter
Your letter
It said you loved him
But you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wish someday that he would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I saw a letter lying on the floor...

You Said 
It was you, it was me, it was love, it was real, then we touched,
Then we kissed, then we loved da way it feels, it was
Time to spend together leaving all da world behind n I thought it would last
But only time would tell so I waited on time
How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes
It was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth
Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why you
Wanna play me, you said, you would never me said,
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me
We were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me
You needed me da only one to ease your mind I was
Caught by surprise to hear you say you wanna leave
But it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around
How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes it
Was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth
[2x]
 Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why

1001 Nuits 
Hier encore j'ai mal dormi
J'ai cru entendre du bruit
Le lendemain j'ai appris que les keufs avaient fait une sauterie
Fruit de l'op?ration : un homme mort dans son lit
Cela fait d?j? une semaine si on en croit l'autopsie
Ca fait maintenant 1001 nuits que j'ai le sommeil l?ger
Je n'ai ferm? qu'un oeil, les sir?nes m'ont r?veill?
J'ai vu des gyrophares bleus fuser dans toute la ville
A la poursuite de voitures aux mains des conducteurs habiles
Mes voisins d'en face j'les ai jamais sentis
Car du soir au matin j'entendais des cris
C'?tait le mari qui tabassait sa femme et ses enfants
Mais le jour de son jugement on lui a dit t'es innocent
2, 3 mecs dans mon quartier sont partis s'amuser en boite
Et pour pas finir dans la boite, arm?s jusqu'au cou ils d?barquent
Ca s'?clate un max tout le monde est p?t? au whiskas
En 10 secondes ?a tourne en coups de bouteilles et en coup de chlas
J'suis choqu? quand j'vois dormir des SDF dehors allong?s par terre
J'ai l'impression qu'ils sont morts
Perdus dans leurs cauchemars entre la vie et la mort
C'est ? la morgue que cet hiver on retrouvera leur corps
Ca fait ? peine 5 minutes qu'un d?tenu est lib?rable
Les murs l'ont rendu instable j'crois qu'il a p?t? un c?ble
La nuit est ? sa merci y'a rien de bon dans son regard
Le lendemain tr?s t?t, retour a la case d?part
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
A notre instar dans l'ghetto c'est l'abattoir
Vaut mieux ?'tre vigilant et vif sur tous trottoirs
Les espoirs sont minces, tu connais l'histoire
Fais gaffe ? toi ce soir on t'attend dans ton couloir
Perdu dans une soir?e, j'suis m?me pas invit?
Y'avait que des cr?nes ras?s avec des blousons de l'arm?e
Dans leurs levis serr?s, au cou la croix gamm?e
Apparemment des skins d?cid?s et affam?s
Plus le temps passe passe plus il fait sombre sombre
Plus les nuits tombent tombent
Plus de fr?res ? l'ombre l'ombre
La nuit c'est le bordel, parfois c'est mortel
Demande aux keufs qu'ils se prennent des explosifs comme cocktail
Apres une demi heure de marche, on s'?gare dans une impasse
Un chat noir qui passe, synonyme de poisse
Faut pas qu'on reste sur place, y'a comme une odeur de chiasse
Mon pote t'?tais pas loin du compte, y'a les keufs face ? face
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly

10 Minutes Chrono 
Y'a pas qu'nos sant?s qu'on d?t?riore, barrior comme y'a pas ailleurs
On fait trembler Paris comme Capone 
Et les gambinos l'on fait ? Chicago et New York 
? coup d'sulfate et on file ? l'anglaise, 
Chez nous cr?che les meilleurs pilotes, 
10 minutes chrono pour les plus pr?coces 
Pour faire l'amour ou foutre sa vie en l'air 
En tapant un rail ou ? faire l'con sur les railles ? la gare 
Pour s'retrouver d'vant la barre, 
Jusqu'a stopper par une brigade qui s'envergonne defouraille
10 minutes chrono pour s'retrouver au bout du rouleau ou dans l'bon filon, 
R'filer des stocks bourrer d'kilos ou vider l'coffre d'une banque au culot 
Pour prendre un billet d'avion et filer loin 
Comme Nicolas Hullot pour des rouleaux d'euros
On n'est pas frilleux on a le prix nobel des rebelles
On est des filloux des foullets
10 minutes chrono pour ?merger au reveil 
Une fraction d'secondes pour t'manger un pruneau ou faire un tonneau
Refrain
Ca sent mauvais quand t'entends les corbeaux 
Tout peut basculler d'une minute ? l'autre 10 minutes chrono
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
ou d'vant un coffre qui p?se trop lourd
Chut pas un mot si on coince si on pince on est pas ronds 
Ca peut basculer d'une minute ? l'autre 10 minutes chrono hhah 
On a les crocs nous on est comme d'vant un porno 
ou d'vant un coffre qui p?se trop lourd
10 minutes chrono pour prendre ta douche en cage, 
Pour faire ton pactage ou apr?s un gros coup 
Pour faire le partage pour rafler le pactole
Toutes les 10 minutes passe une patrouille 
Dans ma banlieue y'a pas d'puits de p?trole
Pour duper les cam?ras de surveillance 
Y'a plus grand chose qui nous ?pate, on a un mental en m?tal
10 minutes chrono pour tout perdre aux cartes
Savourer un joint du N?pal ou ? la bourse pour couler tes finances
10 secondes pour qu'un videur t'recalle en bo?te et t'd?bo?te 
Faut pousser la b?te, la navette, enfiler la veste ? capuche 
10 minutes chrono pour toucher un crapus en visant le foie,
Plus 1 fois 10 minutes pour creuser un trou ? la pelle dans un bois 
S'qu'on ? a faire on l'repousse jamais ? redois
Escalade sur les toits on parle p't'?tre de toi
10 minutes chrono pour qu'ma clique soit aux abois
Pour beaucoup moins qu'?a on t'fume si tu laisses une ardoise derri?re toi
Refrain
Des fois y a un flic, y a ton coeur qui palpite
Essaye de semer les flics sur les voies rapides c'est le temps qu'il te faut
Pour accoler une racli, pour vider une bombe lacrymon?ge ? un CRS
Pour une petite gaterie, pour manger un maf?, charger les batteries
On a les crocs de la cons' et on boit le sky en Paris ? Vitry
On est pas kho, on veut vite grimper
On est conscient qu'on peut y rester ou regretter
En 10 minutes chrono pour que l'juge t'acquitte ou te mettre perp?te
Pour qu'une bande te taquine ou te rackete
Pour couper une plaquette
4 secondes chrono, h? poucave pour connaitre ta t?te
Pour prendre la poudre d'escamp?te pour r?gler une transac'
Trimballer un gros sac pour le compte d'un gros sac sans piti?
10 minutes chrono pour quitter le pays, le quartier
Juste 10 minutes pour pas se faire allumer
Pour pouvoir partir en entier ou faire cracher le banquier

S?cher les cours comme Miss France 2001

Faible d'esprit, moi je revendique les murs de t?ci
Respect aux miens post? sur le bitume pour se faire un lletbi
Vitry Orly une association est faite
Malfaiteurs organis?s, y'a m?me des coupeurs de t?tes
Bombe lyricale, attaque verbale, ?a va faire mal
Trois malfrats sur une mission, l'instinct animal
C'?tait AP, freestyle racaille, je te l'ai d?ja dit
Clash pas surtout cette combinaison de MC
Ouais, clash pas surtout cette combinaison de MC
Du hall 13 au demi-lune zoo, on s'associe
Rim K
Si tu n'est pas down tu cr?ves, tranchant comme un glaive
Rim K du 113
J'arrose tous les rrozes, je me pose y'aura pas de tr?ves
Viens te frotter ? une vraie pourriture
Le ressortissant des cit?s HLM, qui pose sa signature
Le clan balance la sauce, Vitry et Orly en assoc'
Hausse le volume mec, et ne discute pas les ordres du boss
On est par? pour une exp?dition punitive
On fait tourner le mic comme un spliff pour fumer nos cibles
Ils ne savent pas que notre association est ? craindre
Les couleurs du drapeau fran?ais avec nous vont d?teindre
La moindre erreur de ta part pourrait me pousser ? t'?teindre
Je te garantis que ce sera fait si nos lois tu veux les enfreindre
Tu veux les enfreindre
Ose franchir notre seuil, on t'envoie dans un cercueil
Car ? coup de chlap dans ta gueule, c'est comme ?a qu'on t'accueille
Je t'annonce d?j? ce qui sera ?crit sur ta pierre tombale
Ex?cut? par Rim K, soup?onn? d'?tre un trou de balle
Du cran c'est ce qu'il te faut, pour t'approcher de mes rangs
Il te faut une assurance vie, avant d'entrer dans la cour des grands
C'est toujours genre, je te baise, je r?side toujours au 113
Rappelle toi bien, que si t'es pas down tu cr?ves
De la rime au cris un seul pas et on l'a d?j? franchis
Ici trois lascars de t?ci s'associent, ainsi si tu testes les vieilles
Ainsi s'ach?ve ce freestyle racaille tranchant comme le bled 
De la rime au cris un seul pas et on l'a d?j? franchis
Ici trois lascars de t?ci s'associent, ainsi si tu testes les vieilles
Ainsi s'ach?ve ce freestyle racaille tranchant comme le bled
Mafia k'1 fri
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Si t'es pas down tu cr?ves, tranchant comme un glaive
Rim K du 113
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
J'arrose tous les rrozes, je me pose, y'auras pas de tr?ves
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Viens te frotter ? une vraie pourriture
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Je pose ma signature
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Vitry Orly en assoc', on balance la sauce
Il y a association de malfaiteurs

Au Summum 
Refrain
Au summum, on prends des risques on s'fout des lois on mise tout, 
Si un jour la chance se pr?sente on tente tout, au maximum jusqu'au bout 
Rim-K
J'tiens au respect, c'est moi Rim-K
Courage si t'a ?cop? pour plus de six mois, 
Tous furax comme dans Snatch, j'mourais chez moi, 
Suspect comme l'arri?re-sale d'un resto chinois, 
Compte sur moi, pour repr?senter nos fav?las ? nous, 
Et si t'es chez les fous jug?s par des faux qui visent le full, 
Le brelant trop branleur, le carr? d'as, 
On a du mal ? dispercer dans les foules ou sort des mar?cages d'escalier, 
S'il faut bien que j'entame un sprint, 
Vas y donne la r?plique aux salopards comme Larry Flint, 
Je suis parre-balle sous ma retskin en souplesse comme Jet Li, 
J'bosse pour la Kabylie mon jet-ski, 
Sache que la peur n'apporte rien a l'homme, d?s l'aube ? l'oeuvre, 
Profite de chaque minute, pour les fr?res ? l'ombre, 
Mise au summum ? l'aise, comme Schumi en Ferrari, 
Sur les circuits avec ce qu'il faut sous l'lit insoumis
Refrain
AP
Dans un coin sombre ?a joue au carte, comme au casino, 
Comme dans casino, sur la table les cl?s d'un coup?, d'un pavillon, 
On sait c'est qui qui domine, 
On sait qui part au boulot avec une mauvaise mine en pensant ? Deauville, 
Qui s'soucie du gouvernement, toujours les m?mes qui mentent 
ou passent de sales moments, clin d'oeil aux garnements
Qu'on d'ja la gouache des 12 13 ans la merde qui leur pends au nez 
Et vivre l'instant pr?sent, ok, certains ont le mauvais train de vie, 
Se sont tromp?s de wagon, se mettent ? bosser ? la cha?ne comme ? Sa?gon, 
Ou Taiwan ?a s'ressent comme la marie-jeanne, 
Si t'es pas d'accord sale con, on va toujours au summum
Quand on s'y met au sommet sur l'ciment, sur les champs de cannabis, 
Sur tout le terrain num?ro dix, avec le c?ur on s'en m?le, 
Pour les mecs bourr?s d'vices ou les novices
Refrain
Au summum on prend des risque on s'fout des loi ont mise tout, 
Ai un jour la chance se pr?sente on tente tout, 
Au maximum jusqu'au bout, jusqu'au bout, jusqu'au bout ... 
On mise tout, on mise tout, on mise tout
Au summum, si un jour la chance se pr?sente, au summum
On tente tout
Rim-K
Au summum dans nos quartiers ? haut risques 
Actifs comme la ballistique dans notre ville, 
J'raconte qu'les faits, j'suis carp? comme un pit sans museli?re, 
On s'voit mal finir notre carri?re comme Jordan ? 40 piges
Sp?cial haute voltige, 113, c'est comme tes deux doigts dans la prise, 
Ou tes deux pieds dans la crise au summum le ghetto est la cerise 
Comme une arme bien huil?e, avec du charisme on prend le bl? o? il est

?coute pendant qu'ton string seche, fluide est mon clan

Les jaloux disent qu'on meure bient?t ? ce qu'il parrait 
Ma vie de nombreux p?riples 
Je prends le fric des MC qui ? chaque sortie du p?riph?rique 
Apelle ? tous les gor?s faut qu'on s'alourdisse
Je pr?pare des trucs horribles dans ma cat?gorie
On veut me tester sur mon terrain sans aucune descente

C'est Ici Que La Vie Commence 
Refrain : 
On est tous pourris par la cit?, 
Hant? par la monnaie 
J'suis pas cingl? au point de vivre dans la pauvret? 
C'est ici que la vie commence 
Entre violence et souffrance 
Chacun a sa cause et s'en bat les couilles des cons?quences 
Armaggedon, fiston, sonne, 
Le monde est sous l'contr?le dune poign?e dhomme ? la solde 
Le seul empire s'attend sur le compte de Babylone 
C'est en ces lieux maudits que le pire et la vie commence 
Ouvre les yeux et grandir dans une salle banlieue en France 
La justice brutalise nos fr?res, les p?res sont blas?s 
Ca pue la pisse autour de nous, la merde, le prix du danger 
Les m?moires sont balafr?s, donc ? chacun ces entailles 
La haine a remplac?e l'amour, lamour nest plus de taille 
Le quotidien un affront, un reflet dont parfois j'ai honte 
Cash, rage et bastons, si je m'en sors, cest pour mon compte 
Les temps sont durs, les hommes sont durs, mon ghetto c'est s?r 
Si tu n'r?agit plus, tu touche le fond au fur et ? mesure 
Quand rien ne progresse, m?me les n?gros se bouffent entre eux 
Un simple regard blesse, ?a mec c'est pire quun coup de feu 
Hardcore r?alit?, c'est pour ma rime urbaine 
Les jours sont les m?mes ici ? Vitry Sur Seine 
Refrain. 
Toujours la m?me chose, l'homme en uniforme bleu restera maudit 
Dans chaque banlieue, et dans chaque t?-ci 
Babylone va sombrer, les jeunes sont r?volt?s 
Le signale est donn?, le face ? face peut commencer 
J'serais pas un de ces n?gros qui travaillera pour l?tat 
Pas d'uniforme bleu, jferais encore moins les 10 mois 
Hors de tout ?a, l'm?ne tranquillement ma petite vie 
Le n?gro de la rue, ruff d'esprit et 100% insoumis 
Avec un flow de bicot qui r?sonne dans tout les bas les haut 
On compte se faire du cash avec, pour ensuite rouler en Merco 
Saper en costards, ? la bouche un putain de cigare 
Un simple mauvais regard et blaaah, je t'exp?dies sur lbillard 
J'pr?pare mon heure de gloire avec mes banlieusards 
Cela m?me si j'dois niquer des ann?es de ma vie au placard 
Mec tant pis, on est tous pourris par la cit? 
Hant? par la monnaie, j'suis pas cingl? au point de vivre dans la pauvret? 
Moi je frappe dans le mille de mon crew et pr?t pour l'an 2000 
Le syst?me et ses conneries, putain c'est pas facile 
Ma zic berce l'adolescence, r?veille la d?linquance 
J'te parle du bitume, gar?on de par mes connaissances 
On veut tous, partir loin des tours, connaitre de nouveaux jours 
Savoir sacrifier sa peau, mourir pour son amour 
J'veux pas devenir une caille mais je tavoue que parfois que ?a mtente 
Pour sortir de c'putain de merdier des solutions, yen a pas 50 
ROHFF dit, la vie est une salope, la moindre erreur c'est lcar-pla 
Travailler dur pour r?ussir, n?gro t'as pas lchoix 
C'est ici que la vie commence, le crash, le quotidien 
Tous dans la m?me merde, d?brouillard pour voir plus loin

Fout La Merde 
J'arrive, je fous la merde comme en concert 
Et je m'jette dans la foule comme un rocker 
Morceau lourd, pas comme Ramzy 
Fous la merde vas-y, Gros, c'est les rham? 
C'est rhami (cest les tontons, cest chaud) 
Les murs transpirent, enl?ve ton T-Shirt, Mani 
On t'mets ? poil comme au 421, au casino ou 
Miami rhinami, l'ami (comme si de rien n?tait) 
Ghetto comme ? Harlem quand on s'ram?ne 
En prison, rends fous les matons 
Si t'es en auto accompagne ce son ? coups de klaxon 
Les gyrophares de keufs en guise de spots 
Des sc?nes ? immortaliser sur cam?scope 
A tous les ?tages de ta tour 
Un son ? te faire griller les feux 
S?cher les cours comme Miss France 2001 
D?lire bonhomme Hors limite ? te faire 
Rentrer ? l'aube roule-toi un gros fumig?ne 
C'est le sexe desserre les fesses 
M?me si tu squattes les bancs jusqu'? en 
Avoir la marque sur les fesses. 
M?me les Foufs sont de m?che 
Fous la merde et garde la p?che 
Refrain 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde ! 
J'arrive je fous la merde comme au Parc des Princes 
Avec mon staff comme Guy Roux on est tous des pinces 
Mouvements de foule de fous 
 Ouais, tout ? fait  comme dirait Thierry 
Relou ou Jean Michel Claqu? 
113 l'?quipe tentends par les murs qui tremblent ? 
C'est comme le 15 de France dans ta chambre 
C'est michto, re-cui,501, boule-?-z?ro 
y'a plus de cheveux qui frisent comme Rocheteau, 
Oh poto fous la merde comme aux puces 
ou comme aux heures de pointe dans le bus 
ou comme au studio quand on bosse 
bouge la t?te jusqu'au torticolis 
m?me gripp? et malade on t'sort du lit 
Si t'es en discoth?que, rentre dans le tas 
L?ve le doigt en l'air, fais le grand ?cart comme Travolta 
Si tu vois flou et que tu rentres saoul 
L?ve la cuvette et comme Tiger Woods vise bien le trou

Hold Up 
J'suis postich?, j'ai les m?mes cheveux qu'Dalida 
La barbe de Fidel Castro et un gros beretta 
La gabardine de Columbo, les lunettes d'Elton John 
Et la d?gaine distingu?e des fr?res Dalton. 
Les lieux sont rep?r?s, 9 H devant la banque, 
J'suis devant le sas, je sonne et je rentre, 
J'fais la queue comme tout le monde, 
Mes potes m'attendent 2 rues plus loin, 
J'suis op?rationnel dans 30 secondes, 
Je guette le vigile qui m'regarde bizarre, 
Je m'approche de lui et j'lui dis qu'est-c'que tu veux connard ? 
J'lui mets un coup de plafond 
Et direct j'lui sors mon arme, 
Je braque la grosse pute qui s'trouve derri?re le comptoir: 
Ferme ta gueule, on va pas en faire toute une histoire. 
D'ailleurs ouvre le sas y'a mes potes sur le trottoirs, 
Je sors les sacs de sport en un temps record, 
J'veux juste l'oseille et dans 5 minutes je sors. 
Refrain: 
On fait notre entr?e dans la banque 
Sans faire toc-toc-toc 
113 / Intouchable, ferme ta gueule, c'est un hold-up ! 
On braque, charge les sacs et on d?colle, 
La main sur la d?tente, tu seras pas l'seul ? embrasser l'sol ( x 2 ) 
D?mon / AP 
Montre en main tout est OK 
J'suis pr't pour le feu d'artifice concentr? dans mes pens?e, remarque 
L'entr?e des artistes, artistes cagoul?s, 
J'donne l'ordre que tout l'monde s'mette ? terre, 
J'tire une fois en l'air, c'est bon on a le feu vert. 
Monsieur le directeur, on vient relever les compteurs. 
On va passer 1 heure ? attendre les inspecteurs, 
Assez parl?, et passons aux choses s?rieuses, 
J'ai pas l'temps de m'attarder, chaque seconde me sont pr?cieuses, 
Pendant qu'on est dans les temps, je m'occupe de l'argent de surface, du 
Travail de pro, t'inqui?te, on laissera pas de trace. 
J'remplis les sacs ? bloc et l? la pourriture veille, 
Si ?a tourne au drame, on va laisser des cervelles. 
Direction la salle des coffres, j'emm?ne le directeur au sous-sol, 
Mais l? y'a un p'tit probl?me c'batard veut pas cracher le code. 
Oblig? de le sequester car y'a refus d'obtemp?rer, 
Il a fallu que je lui fasse des photos de sa femme ligot?e, 
Je prends en otage un client qu'a voulu faire le justicier, 
Canon sur la tempe, refais plus ?a, sinon j'vais t'tuer, 
De ce hold-up on en chie, ?a risquerait de finir en boucherie, 
Y'a plus de temps ? perdre, on s'dirige vers la sortie, 
Je remonte les escaliers, les sacs charg?s on peut y aller, 
Je crois qu'les gars on a touch?, un tr?s gros paquet de billets, 
Mais j'allais oublier, j'prends le directeur pour couvrir la fuite, 
Ne paniquez pas on va l'lacher sur le p?riph'. 
OK on s'barre, dans les sacs plus de 100 barres, je pr?viens le D, 
Le M qui sont rest?s ? l'?cart, ? la sortie de la banque, on se pr?cipite vers 
La planque, le D est pr?t ? partir avant qu'il y ait une descente, 
Y a rien qui manque, non ! Le D est l? ? Ouais ! Le M est l? ? 
Ouais ! La pourriture ? Ouais ! Le colonel ? Ouais ! Ouais ! 
Refrain 
Dry 
Apr?s une entr?e surprenante, une sortie plut?t fracassante, 
Mes membres en attente, dans l'attente d'une couille imminente, 
J'garde le contact,d?mon One plus que 10 secondes, 
Plus qu'un sac Gros. 
Juste assez de temps pour finir ma blonde, 
Ils ont l'air charg?s, je pense que le coup a march?, 
Dry au volant, je vous conseille de vous accrocher, 
Freins ? main, t?te ? queue, trace avec mes complices, VR6, 
Compteur 2, 3, 4 et j's?me ta police, j'reprends le volant, 
Sans avoir fait de contr?le technique, 
Mais cette fois-ci moi j'fonce dans le tas, 
Si ?a se complique. 
Ici le M pour le D, premi?re ? droite, keufs ? 500 m?tres... 
Eh ! Y'a d'la poucav ou quoi ? Ces PD's bouchent le p?rim?tre , 
Chronom?tre ? la main, fusil ? port?e de main, 
Personne nous freine car par les quai, moi j'connais le chemin.

J'me fais tout p'tit pour pas qu'les videurs me tricar
A l'entr?e ?a refoule, on n'accepte pas les f?tards
Accompagn?, faut l'?tre si tu veux danser
Le physio qu'est ?la porte ne parle pas un mot fran?ais
2m10, un clando, un beau morceau
Mais ce soir, c'est s?r qu'il y aura de beaux morceaux
Dans les poches plein de biftons de quoi m'amuser
Prendre la bouteille, ?tal? sur un canap?
Veste enroul?e autour du bras, tout le monde est sur la piste
Petits pas synchronis?s qu'on a r?p?t? ? dix
Moi et mes complices sur la m?me longueur d'ondes
J'ai d?j? choisi ma go
et pour mon pote j'ai rep?r? une blonde
Y a du monde dans la salle, les as en Lacoste
Le DJ a ses platines, sa mixette et son vieux poste
Tu sais nos beaux d?lires on ne les a pas oubli?s
Des bonnes soir?es y'en n'a pas des milliers
Entre jackpotes, on donne ?a ? l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui tra?nent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
J'ouvre mon armoire j'prends une chemise m?me pas repass?e
J'regarde dans la glace et j'me dis c'est d?class?
A c't'heure-ci, ? l'entr?e ?a doit s'tasser
Oh calmez-vous
Alors j'rase ma barbe de 2 semaines, j'suis pas press?
?a devrait passer m'me si j'ai les yeux cass?s
Et m?me si j'suis avec 8, 9 disjonct?s
On cache nos armes dans le buisson
Ma gueule s'marie bien avec le son
Hey gar?on, c'est pour moi l'addition
On a dans? comme des tar?s, j'suis essouffl?
Pour m'raffraichir j'vais au bar pour consommer
Accoud? sur l'comptoir, les lunettes Cartier baiss?es
J'remarque que tous mes potes venaient juste d'arriver
Et la j'l?ve mon verre de coca, j'picole pas
J'porte un toast ? tous mes fr?res d'africa et c'est comme ?a
Vu l'ambiance, fallait du cran pour stopper la sono
On rentrera ? la cite ? l'heure du premier m?tro
Entre jackpotes on donne ?a ? l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui tra?nent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
J'suis dans l'arri?re salle du cote official
Faut toujours 'tre optimal avec mon p'tit verre de sky
Et m'laisse aller sur un son de Georges Benson
Les stomboscopes font briller mes Jean Marie Weston
A l'ancienne j'fais un p'tit tour sur moi-m'me
Dans la foul?e rep?re une jolie demoiselle
Toutes les femmes ce soir se sont fait belles
Sans aucun doute j'mets mon p'tit grain d'sel
N'abuse pas sur la boisson j'ten prie fais pas le con
Hey baisse d'un ton, tu sais ? qui t'as affaire tonton
J'suis avec Jeannot Mandjack adoss? ? un poteau
Ce soir c'est relax j'suis avec mes jackpotos
Ici c'est timal j'suis avec ap dans l'arri?re salle
Montez tous dans le golf et dans 5 minutes on remballe
Et tetkal ce soir c'est festival
En 2000 on met ?a l?gal c'est la totale

Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
Entre jackpotes on donne ?a ? l'ancienne

La Familia 
C'est pour la famille.
Une pens?e pour ceux qu'ont perdu leurs parents.
Maman n'est plus toute jeune aussi, c'est la seule femme que j'aime.
Comme tous les parents du monde, ils m'ont vu avocat ou m?decin
Toujours un enfant ? leurs yeux, trop de fois j'suis absent
J'cr?ve l'abc?s de l'amour, 
Comme ceux qui ont mal tourn?, parce qu'on les as d?tourn?s.
Les conseils de la famille, c'est l'exemple de mes parents 
Que je retiens pour que demain soit OK.
J'ai su me prendre en main pour chaque journ?e.
C'est comme un contrat qu'on a sign?, 
J'ai jamais insult? mon p?re ni ma m?re, toujours le respect.
En tourn?e, je me sens loin de vous, 
Mais sachez que mon coeur est toujours l? pr?s de vous
Il y a votre sang, il y a votre chair, mon ciment
Il y a l'Afrique, vous ?tes ma terre, mon continent.
Refrain (x2)
Trop de fois j'ai troubl? vos nuits de sommeil, 
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous ? moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on d?tient, 
C'est le coeur qui parle, c'est le coeur qui parle.
Y'a rien de plus pr?cieux, mon p'tit fr?re, 
Ma p'tite soeur, ma m?re, je garde sous les yeux.
J'me sens coupable, coup? du monde, d?s que je te vois souffrir.
Je m'excuse en chanson, maman, je tenais ? te dire, la nuit, le plus souvent
J'y pense ? chaque fois, tous ces moments o? nous ?tions en froid, rappelle toi.
J'?tais peut-?tre trop na?f, trop jeune pour comprendre, 
Alors qu'il suffisait d'en parler pour s'en-tendre.
C'est douloureux mais la famille y'a rien de plus pr?cieux.
Mon p'tit fr?re, ma p'tite soeur, je garde sous les yeux.
Ils sont si jeunes, des fois je chiale comme ma m?lodie.
Mon coeur a faibli comme frapp? par une maladie
J'ai des l?sions internes, je suis un homme, ?a devrait aller.
Tous ces mots montrent ? quel point nous sommes li?s.
Pr?s du b?ton, du sol, o? je suis l'a?n?, je suis pas le seul
J'en connais le salaire, le soir quand j'rentre seul.
Y'aura toujours des cris et des larmes, 
succ?deront les sourires qui r?chaufferont nos armes
Pour refaire place aux fou rires.
Refrain (x2)
Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses, 
Prends ta m?re dans tes bras, gros, fais lui une grosse bise.
A la femme la plus courageuse du monde
Tout comme toi j'aimerais avoir du coeur et ?tre aussi croyant que mon p?re
On n'a pas eu la m?me jeunesse, 
Dieu sait que depuis que je sais lire et ?crire
J'ai pas connu la guerre mais presque, j'ai connu Vitry.
Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses, pour la paix de l'esprit, je paye le prix
C'est mon p?re qui me l'a appris, avec un grand fr?re comme soutient
Des soeurs qui n'ont jamais d?shonorer la famille 
Et ? qui je tiens des deux ?tres que j'ai pas toujours ?cout?
Certes de moi-m?me je suis d?go?t?, parfois d?rout?
En esp?rant que Dieu et ma famille vous me pardonnez.
Inch'Allah, j'viendrai ? bout de vos soucis.
Apr?s tout ce que vous avez subi, je vous souhaite une longue vie
Je tiens ? vous l'avoir dit, avant que vous ?coutiez ceci 
De la part d'un homme, votre fils.

Le Guide Du Loubard 
{au Refrain, x2}
C'est le guide du loulou, bar, by night, dans tous les coups foireux et dans toutes les arnaques.
J'suis un putain d'clando, j'arrive de Vitry en cargo.
Dans le rap, j'veux 80% du march? comme Pablo.
Je m'appelle Rim-K alias D?d?, dans le quartier tout le monde me conna?t.
J'connais les rues comme si j'les avais faites, j'suis la cerise sur le ghetto.
J'tra?ne toujours dans l'm?me bar avec les m?mes roulures, les m?mes loubards.
Depuis que j'ai la t?l? en couleur, en embrouille avec mon rasoir, depuis l'?poque Beloumi et Madjar.
Je vis, ?a me suffit, y a peu de choses que je savoure
Mon autoradio vol?, toujours une cassette de Renaud ou d'Aznavour.
Conduite nocturne en ?tat d'ivresse en 16S.
Un contr?le de police et j'fais p?ter l'alcotest
Je refuse jamais une bagarre ? mains nues ou au tourne-vis.
Connu des mioches ou des vigiles de Leclerc, fils.
J'raconte aux filles pleins de conneries.
J'mange aux cr?pes en pastiche, eh l'aziz, d'vant les pompes ? essence de nuit
Et gros, je me barre, j'enfile un jeans, apr?s avoir passer une heure au chiotte avec un magazine.
{au Refrain, x2}
Toujours contre l'mur j'murmure, toujours un peu crasseux sur les bords
J'crache, j'ro-te, j'me censure.
Tord boyaux et pollen, quand je suis sage, Minute Maid.
Je tra?ne qu'avec des Mamadou et des Mohamed
J'suis bousill? comme mon interphone, tu m'as bien vu, tard le soir dans la rue
J'suis pris au s?rieux par Interpole.
C'est l'guide du loubard, c'est pas le titre d'un film tout pourri de banlieue
Tu ressens bien le b?ton ? cent lieux.
C'est Rim-K alias D?d? tout le quartier me conna?t, je connais les rues comme ma poche.
Quand y a du grabuge, j'mes la capuche, l'?charpe pour les manifs
Grand dieu, rend gr?ce au taxi baskets et aux petits week-ends avec les sounds de quartiers
Dans les petites provinces o? on barbait tout.
?a rime pas, j'm'en fous, c'est mon morceau j'fais ce que je veux, qui veut test le loubard ?
J'suis dans tous les petits boulots, le pr?f?r? des petites vieilles
Le m?cano, toujours les mains dans les calots.
Quand je m'ennuie, un jour j'?tais en garde-?-vue, pourquoi ?
J'sais plus, en tout cas personne n'a dormi.
Un clando, roi du poker, de la Playstation et de la 103 SP, j'marche bancal et j'parle sans respect.
J'aime bien les films de Bruce Lee, j'ai test? la prise sur un mec, j'lui ai p?t? la m?choire.
Deux mois de pur?e Mousline.
Ecris ? la baraque en chaus-sons.
Alors, hein ! Elle vous plait ma chanson.

Le Princes De La Ville 
Peu d'?l?gance dans mes ?crits, normal pour un mec de Vitry
Sur ma feuille le ghetto, je retranscris
Zigzaguant entre le mal et les d?lits
Jeune d?brouillard, une fois sorti du lit
Au ch?mage pourtant jeune et ambitieux
C'est pour nous qu'ils ont cr?? l'ANPE
Mais y a une queue d'un kilom?tre pour gagner 3 p?p?tes
Si j'peux permettre qu'ils aillent se faire mettre
Alors les bacheliers s'engagent ? l'arm?e
Et pour le petit smicard y a de quoi s'alarmer
Des bracos ? main arm?e car tout ?a y'en a marre mais
Un jour les keufs viennent te ramener
Vitry 9-4 de ma ville j'veux ?tre le prince
J'vais pas t'cacher que Monsieur le maire est 1 pince
Des promesses y a pas ? dire il en a toujours
R?nover les batiments on attend toujours
Et vos monuments ? 100 barres nous on s'en fout
Soit-disant d?put? en costard ils sont fous
Comme tout citoyen j'suis cens? aller voter
Histoire de dire que j'existe dans leur communaut?
A la suite j'f?licite les gros bonnets de l'illicite
Pas d'ing?nieur dans mon ?quipe
{Refrain:}
On est jeune et ambitieux
Parfois vicieux
Faut qu'tu dises que
Tu peux ?tre le prince de la ville si tu veux
O? tu veux, quand tu veux
Ambitieux parfois vicieux...
On vit en HLM les uns sur les autres
Les lits superpos?s, j'ai rien connu d'autre
On a la rage mais comment rester sage
On vis en marge, en gros on est tous barges
Souvent les huissiers ? ta porte font ?ruption
Si tu payes pas ton loyer c'est l'expulsion
Val de Marne haut pourcentage d'immigration
Aussi ?lev? que tous mes fr?res qu'ils mettent en prison
Et pour s'payer un avocat faut plein de pascals
Au tribunal on s'en sort toujours mal
?a se ressent dans les sentences on a jamais eu d'chance
Vu les circonstances, fuck la p?nitence
T'as pas r?gle tes amendes, le Tr?sor Public t'a coinc?
Fini les vacances d'?t?, tu fais des TIG
Sur toi on met la pression
Ta boite aux lettres est pleine de rappels et d'assignations
Ouais mec c'est ?a notre vie
Code 94400 Vitry
La banlieue a ses qualit?s et ses d?fauts
Peuple?s d'artistes et de sportifs de haut niveau
D'escrocs dans les halls jusqu'aux bureaux municipaux
Tous vitriots
Et m?me si c'est pas tous les jours facile
J'veux ?tre le prince de la ville

Les Evades 
(Avec Rohff Ogb, Mokem)
Heu, appel ? toutes les unit?s 
On recherche quatre ?vad?s 
d'un quartier chaud de Vitry sur Seine 
Description, deux n?gros, deux beurs 
Je r?p?te deux n?gros, deux beurs 
Ils sont pr?t ? tout 
Pour eux, il n'y a ni barri?res, ni barreaux, ni fronti?res 
Donc on quadrille le terrain et s'il faut, on lache les chiens 
Attention ils sont arm?s et dangereux 
Rim-K 
Pour des jours meilleurs 
Je fais mon premier pas ? l'ext?rieur 
Tension sup?rieur 
Je reste ? la hauteur avec la mort comme peur 
Tragique destin, faut comprendre 
M?me si les keufs vont cramer 
Sache que jamais j'irais me rendre 
Nos fr?res d'Afrique ont organis? notre fuite 
Mais il y'a une couille 
Y'a poursuite derri?re moi 
S'agrippe un tas de flics 
Faut que j'assume, y'a pas ? chier, y'a pas ? discuter 
Le jour o? on m'a boucl? 
C'est comme si on m'avait amput? 
Encul? si j'avais pus, je vous aurais tous br?l? 
Mais je ne pense qu'a les semer 
Mon heure n'as pas encore sonn? 
Diff?rentes p?rip?ties 
Je suis comme un gibier dans la nature 
Je cavale et rase les murs 
Je cherche un endroit s?r 
Peu ? peu j'esquive ces ordures 
Je vais plus loin que la censure putain d'envergure 
C'est bien moi RIM K, la pourriture 
J'arrive au QG mMalheureusement de partout je saigne 
J'ai bris? les cha?nes 
Pour ma patrie, Vitry sur Seine 
Refrain (x2) 
Mokem 
Putain tricard, traqu? 
T?te mise ? prix, t?te fich? 
Recherch?, en vente dans tous le pays 
Des ?vad?s, 113 pr?sum? dangereux 
Tu me coupe la route, c'est bouillant 
On ouvre le feu 
OGB 
Malheureusement c'est reparti en couille 
Pas le temps de se lamenter 
Va falloir faire preuve de d?brouille 
Faut surtout pas se faire attraper 
On vit chacun de notre c?t? 
Un seul but, une cit? 
P?n?trer dans une cage d'escalier 
Pour observer leurs gestes et faits 
Agir comme des ?vad?s 
Surveill? de pr?s par les kond?s 
Cette fois d?cid?, les points ferm?s 
Agissant les yeux ferm?s 
A matraquer puis menotter un gamin 
Lui faire la hala au commissariat jusqu'au lendemain 
De toute fa?on, on n'y peut rien 
Il faut comprendre, il faut apprendre 
Qu'il n'existe pas de choix en commun 
Pour faire face ? son propre destin 
Je continue ma route la d?marche lente et m?fiante 
La peur d'?tre identifi? par des voisins me hante 
Mes potos me manquent d?j? 
Et personne n'est pr?t ? m'affirmer 
Qu'ils ne sont pas de retour au Kapla d?j? 
Au grands mots, les grands moyens 
J'intervient, 113 rue Camille Groult 
Quant il le faut c'est l? o? je serais pr?sent sur le terrain 
Rohff 
Soldat en cavale qu'en a marre des cellules 
Marre des promenades la justice, je l'encule 
Me sentir on prends en otage en mal je m'?vade 
Pour mes assoc' m?nent un escapade 
Je fais sauter le grillage 
Je marche en zig zag carri?re fusillade 
Devant moi la libert? ce n'est pas un mirage 
Je revois enfin le paysage 
Ca fait temps d'ann?e que je r?ve de vivre ces images 
Situation critique 
La sc?ne aussi hardcore que cette musique 
Mon coeur bat trop vite 
Mon corps fatigue je casse ma pipe 
Faut que je fasse le vide 
Nique sa m?re, les remords 
Faut pas que je m'endorme parce que le sommeil 
C'est le cousin de la mort 
Ennemi publique comme Jacques Mesrine 
Anti fanatique, je m'instruis 
Pour mieux fuck le syst?me 
Je reti, j'arrive au QG 
Faut que je m'arrache d'ici ? tous prix 
Je suis sur qu'? cette heure-ci 
Mon nom est signal? de sonpri ? Roissy 
Des comptes ? r?gler, un procureur ? schlasser 
Des mecs ? effacer 
Une m?re embrasse, avant de tr?passer 
Refrain (x2)

On s'?tait jur? qu'on se retrouverait 
A la vie, ? la mort d?cor prison 
Quatre murs ?a pue la mort 
Evad?, j'ai r?ussi 
Maintenant, je suis dehors 
Marche avec un oeil dans le dos 
Quelque soit mon sort 
Je vois que tout ? changer 
Les rues ne sont plus les m?mes 
Je cours ? travers la ville 
Banlieue sud, Vitry sur Seine 
Sir?ne police, c'est aussi cram? qu'avant 
Me demande bien 
Si mes gars sont aussi dans les temps 
Chrono quatre heures 
C'?tait R.D.V. au ghetto 
Nom de code 113 pour sauver sa peau 
Et c'est reparti A.P. dit l'affranchi 
Je repense aux gueules qu'on a cass? 
Et ces murs qu'on a franchit 
Fini les parloirs, les cantines et la gamelle 
La sale gueule des matons 
Qu'a quatre heures du mat te r?veille 
Puis je d?dicace ce morceau 
A tous les ?vad?s de France 
P?nitencier de merde 
Qu'a voulut baiser mon adolescence

Les Regrets Restent 
Rim-K 
Ca fait d?j?, et puis j'sais m?me plus 
Que j'aurais p? tout laisser tomber 
L'?cole ma laiss? assis sur un banc ? la cit? 
El?ve trop agit?, qui n'en faisait qu? sa t?te 
Je pr?f?rais les manifs au lieu d'aller ? la biblioth?que 
Eh mec, les devoirs, j'les faisais tard le soir 
Et le matin pour m'r?veiller, c?tait tout une histoire 
J'ai jamais eu une bonne entente avec l?ducation nationale 
Le r?glement int?rieur et la fa?on dont ils travaillent 
Dans des classes surcharg?es, 
Toujours les m?mes qui vont au piquet 
Arriv? en fin d'ann?e, pour passer tas pas ton ticket 
La conseillaire, veut de toi se d?barrasser 
T'orienter dans un truc auquel tu nas m?me pas pens? 
Et en rang jamais rang?, combien de mati?res j'ai d? s?cher 
Entre mes premiers rancarts et mon go?t pour le danger 
J'aimais aussi lE.P.S, pour m?ter les seins des gonzes 
Question bizness, toujours un kilo d'pi?ce 
J'ai termin? mes classes dans la rue o? l? j?tais le bienvenu 
Mais i?i les heures de retenus, c'est 24 heures en garde ? vue 
Les ?tudes y'en a ras le cul, le BAC je lai pas eu 
J'sais quau fond pour ma famille 
Pour ?a, j'les aies toujours d??us 
Aujourd'hui comme tu le vois 
C'est la musique que jprends ? coeur 
Pour faire passer le m?ssage, rememorer mes erreurs 
Eviter les ennuis, m?me si j'aime tra?ner la nuit 
J'ai eu raison de l?cole tant que l?cole ne ma pas nuit 
Refrain 
Boss One 
Les ann?es passent, les regrets restent 
On crit en soi pleins de pourquoi? A quoi bon? 
Seule r?ponse: j'sais pas 
Une chose est s?re, en cours j'ai jamais ?t? bosseur 
Juste un acteur de plus, au fond un emmerdeur 
Boss One 
Ce que j'sais en connaissance de gosse 
C'est clair on devrait ttimbrer 
J'voulais dire que m?me, maurais vu conseiller ? lElys?e 
On m'a pouss? vers ce foutu CAP dmenuisier 
Pour eux, mon avenir se trouvait au Baumet ou ? la Sant? 
A grand coups d'balet, mes r?ves se brisaient 
Que dire ? ces m?mes, les yeux pleins d'sympathie 
Qui m'envient dabord qui jsuis 
Une chose est s?re c'est que jai jamais voulu l?cher laffaire 
Ils m'ont mis la pression, 
Press?s d'me voir gicler les cours de Mr CENSON 
Mordu ? l'hame?on, pour ?tre le couillon parmis les cons 
Les insultes pleuvaient vers ce t'enculer dprofs de MATHS 
Il fallait jamais m'prier pour foutre lahyate 
Avec les ann?es tous se gatte, merde 
On s'jette tous dans le m?me bizness eff?m?re 
Histoire de faire vibre-m?re, 
La mis?re a fait de nous ces hommes en... 
Si j'avais s? jaurais jamais quitt? aussit?t les bancs, et tu lsais

 Rim-K 
J'suis dans le rap depuis longtemps pourtant je nai pas carri?re 
Entre l'?cole, la rue et moi m?me jai mis une barri?re 
L'?ducation scolaire, c?tait 4 ans en arri?re 
Combien de fois j'ai d? de?evoir mon p?re et ma m?re 
J'suis un jeune jai la vingtaine 
La cit? m'a mis en quarantaine 
D'origine Africaine, jcrois que jai pris une lourde peine 
Le rap comme rem?de sans ?tre pass? par le solf?ge 
J'suis dans un pi?ge et encore en vie, cest un privil?ge 
L'?volution dun voyou sur les bancs de l?cole 
Avec les cancres du quartier et les sniffeurs de colle 
Devenus ? notre ?poque braqueur ou buveur d'alcool 
Ou forceur d'anti-vol, ? l?cole c?tait b?n?vole 
Recrut? par la rue, ? moi les gr?ces matin?es 
Premi?re mati?re, locas pipe pour pouvoir d?ner 
On fait des matons content de l'oseille 
Et l'anatomie du poste, et l?ducation physique dans la rue 
A nous faire des bosses 
Devenir g?nie en herbe? Non! 
Mais fumer des gros joins d'herbe? Ouais! 
Avec les potes dans les chiottes de lyc?e 
Et faire la feinte aux profs 
 Mr, Mr j'peux aller pisser ?  
Et puis c'est, avec la t?te baiss?e et les yeux pliss?s 
Qu'on revenait au fond de la classe pour oublier 
Attendant impatiement la sonnerie pour pouvois s'barrer 
Avec sa d?gu?ne de Barial le p'tit tape du crime 
Victime du syst?me ? la sortie sans des livres 
Vu nos capacit?s, on aurait p? quitter la cit? 
Pour l'universit? mais bon on a pas profit? 
J'serai peut ?tre jamais friqu? 
Mais bon j'ai pas tout perdu 
J'ai ma culture du guetto et ma lith?rature de rue.

Militant 
J'ai commenc? le rap les l?vres br?l?es par la weed
La voix enrou?e par la 8.6
Mon seul instinct pour guide, ouvre grand mon c?ur 
Comme un livre en live, la life est un combat qu'on livre
Depuis mon premier couplet, paroles d'homme libre 
Je suis militant
Refrain
Reste fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, militant
Fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, je suis militant
Reste fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, tu es militant
Fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant
Comme j'prends un coup de vieux 
? chaque coupe du monde
Entre deux rondes des uniformes
Je fonce, je perds pas une seconde
Si tu restes fid?le ? toi-m?me
Que tu tiens le coup, comme moi
Allume ton briquet, l?ve le haut
Je suis militant, je suis du ghetto, comme toi 
Je suis comme un boxeur dans le vestiaire pour le combat
Je suis volontaire, je l?che rien
Je suis le contraire du poucave qui peut pas se taire
Des malheureux, il y en a des tonnes 
Comme les gangsters dans les ruelles de Kingston 
Du 9.4 et m?me d'ailleurs
T'es pas le sperme, on transperce et tab?re ses gosses
Militant, il ?tait temps comme un p?re qui bosse
Qui se l?ve t?t et se d?cha?ne jamais
Qui prend les transports et bat des records en heures de taf 
Depuis des ann?es jusqu'? canner
Militant comme un p?nitent h?ritant 
D'une longue peine qui r?pond
S.A.N en se disant que Dieu est grand, mon grand
Faut du cran m?me les poches vident, le ventre vide
Il y a qu'? voir comment les gens vivent, paroles dhomme libre
Je suis militant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Si on doit changer les choses c'est maintenant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Solidaire entre les gens du ghetto
Refrain
Ouais gros, 113, soit militant
Jeunes filles, jeunes hommes du ghetto
A.P.
Je suis militant comme ces mecs qui prennent de l'?ge en cage,
Leurs visages marqu?s par la rage qui veulent tourner la page
Comme un clando sans faf, sans appart
Sans taf qui lutte pour apprendre le fran?ais 
Et qui se bat, je parle pour ceux ou pour celles 
Qui portent leurs soucis tout seul
Dans la gal?re jusqu'au col
Pour dormir n'ont plus que le sol
Un RM-iste, 3000 probl?mes
3000 balles par mois, 4000 cailleras
Combien de faits divers par mois
Nombreux sont les ?trangers de son b?timent
Divers drames, 2002, et dans la police combien de potes y voyent 
Y en n'a quun ? qui on doit des comptes
Chacun d?fend sa cause pour une vie modeste et d?cente
M?me l'heure des descentes
Au bout de l'avenue, peu davenir en jungle urbaine 
Militant je tenais ? dire
Je parle au peuple, je suis militant avant de partir
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Militants, jeunes du ghetto tenez coup par tous les temps.....militant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon,
Si on doit changer les choses c'est maintenant,
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon,
Solidaire entre les gens du ghetto.

Principalement cainfri arlbi ou krel
Grilles ? 5 kms dont les keufs interpellent

Si tu veux qu'on s'rappelle de toi y'a rien de tel qu'un bon bed du bled
Pour causer des s?quelles j'r?ponds ? l'appel
Ose, l?ve le glaive

J'sais pas si elle est pucelle
Mais dans le lit y'aura querelle, queue raide

O? pour s'en sortir les jeunes se servent de Biz. Ill?gal 
L'?chec scolaire et la mis?re et ceux depuis l'enfance 
Des gal?res sur les bancs. Jusqu'? la grande d?linquances 
A passer des nuits enti?res entres amis, fumer, du Te-shi 
A penser ? des coups , qui pourrait remener un bon Ill?-bi 
Ils n'?taient pas conscients du risque qu'il y avait ? prendre 
Agir sans concession, les feraient aller dans le mauvais sens 
Au fur et a mesure se sont succ?d?s les gal?res, 
les mauvaises affaires, comblaient leurs casiers judiciaires 
Le destin les a frapp?s cette nuit, 
O? ils ont fait leur plus grosse, erreur dans un putain de taxi 
Deux minutes ont suffis pour que tout se complique 
Pour que l'un devienne meurtrier et l'autre son complice 
De nombreuses personnes ont aper?u cette horrible sc?ne 
Nos bandits. prennent fuite la fuite et craignent une lourde peine 
Apr?s les diff?rentes enqu?tes et d?positions 
pour la 1 ?re fois ils retrouveront en prison 
Le fait d'avoir grandi sans avoir une tune en poche 
poussa les jeunes de cit?s ? vivre avec l'esprit Ruff 
Refrain (x2) 
Gosse de rue regarde ce qu'on est devenu 
Ce qu'on a con?u et parti on fum?e 
Cauchemar les bancs de la Cit? 
Les m?mes gal?res, les m?mes histoires 
Les m?mes refrains 
La gloire ?merge seulement pour quelques-uns 
D?j? les ann?e pass?es, ils n'avaient plus rien a perdre 
ils ne vivaient que de mauvaises affaires sur mauvaises affaires 
Que veux-tu l'argent a fait d'eux un vrai cauchemar 
Ils finiront en prison pour ce taxi tu? sur le trottoir 
Dur ? 16 ans de savoir ce qu'est ton futur 
Une victime de plus enferm? entre 4 murs 
La vie derri?re les barreaux n'est pas celle de la rue 
Aie du sang froid sinon moralement on te tue 
Si tu veux te faire respecter, ne pas te faire marcher sur les pieds 
Les r?gles ne sont plus les m?mes, a toi seul de les appliquer 
Maintenant ils d?pendront d'un simple num?ro 
Car insoumis ? l'?tat est la devise d'un mauvais gar?on 
Avec le temps ils r?ussiront ? s'faire respecter 
Dus aux bagarres entre eux et d'autres prisonniers 
Et enferm?s dans leur cellule, ils repensent au pass? 
O? le soir en quelques instants leur vie s'est compliqu?e 
Il ?tait question d'un simple taxi -Basket 
Nos deux bandits voulaient rentrer sans aucune id?e en t?te 
Combien d'entre-eux se sont vus prendre cette destination 
Du jour au lendemain, passer de la rue ? la prison 
La fait d'avoir grandis sans avoir une tune en poche 
Pousse les gars d'chez moi ? vivre avec l'esprit Ruff 
Cauchemar les bancs de la cit?. 
D?di? ? M.A et J.B.

Sans Retour 
L'album 113, on le d?die avec notre coeur ? ceux qu'on aime
A tous nos proches partis trop t?t
A tous vos proches partis trop t?t
Chaque jour, chaque moment, chaque heure, chaque seconde,
On pense tr?s fort ? vous, pensez ? eux, on vous aime, ?a fait mal
C'est dur d'avoir le go?t de vivre apr?s tout ?a
On vit des moments difficiles, c'est pas facile
Mais heureusement qu'on a la foi en dieu
Sinon ?a ferait longtemps qu'on aurait p?t? les plombs
Qu'on n'aurait plus de raisons de vivre
Tu vois ce que je veux dire
Tu sais les souvenirs ?a s'efface pas, ?a s'efface jamais
Ca reste grave dans nos m?moires, dans nos coeurs
On na?t avec, on vit avec, on dort avec et on meurt avec, malheureusement
Cet album aussi, il est d?di? ? toutes les m?res qui nous ont quitt?
Que leur ?me repose en paix
Que dieu veille sur vous, sur nous, sur nos familles, sur tout le monde
C'est ce qu'on souhaite, on n'oublie personne, on n'oublie personne
On laisse parler la musique

Tonton Des Iles 
Timal, ?a fait un bail, que j'suis pas parti au pays
Voir le reste de la famille et les cousins qu'ont grandi
Apr?s huit heures de charter, me voil? enfin sur mes terres J'suis d?boussol? par le d?calage horaire
Accueilli par un homme d'affaires,
laisse-moi porter tes sacs fr?re
Direction la Basse-Terre, Pointe Noire la case ? grand-m?re
On 'ti punch comme tradition, j'ai dit: "Non merci tonton"
Et lui m'a r?pondu: "Tu t'crois encore ne m?tropole, gar?on"
2, 3 jours apr?s, j'me suis mis dans le bain
un p'tit cale?on de bain, pour les plages et les friapins
Pour faim exotique j'ai d?gust? les plats typiques
Colombo, court-bouillon poisson et cabritt
Pour f?ter mon arriv?e, seul, j'suis parti zouker
Kol? serrer, sur le dernier tube de l'?t?
Touriste de passage "Gu? ti fran?ais la" pour le voisinage
Et toujours cette question, "Alors ? quand le mariage?"
Cette manie de maquerellage, ?a date depuis l'esclavage
Au temps de la rue Case-N?gre, les racines de mon village
J'?tais venu pour me reposer, mon s?jour trop mouvement?
Y avait trop de chose ? faire j'ai pas vu le temps passer
{au Refrain}
Quand j'suis arriv? on m'a dit "Bienvenue au pays"
On m'a dit aussi que j'avais perdu les traditions du pays
Je ravis de revoir les cousins et les cousines qui ont vieilli
Trop longtemps en France je crois bien que ma place se trouve ici
Boissart, Bergevin ?a c'est mon bled cousin
Visite de la Soufri?re en passant que ti chemin
Dans les transports en commun serr?s tous les uns contre les autres
Sur un air de biguine pour aller d'un point ? l'autre
Ici la drogue l?gale c'est la Zeb locale
Sous un soleil tropical tu risquerais de lui faire mal
Allong? sur une des plages sous un palmier
En train de siroter un jus de noix de coco glac?
En pensant ? la famille ?lu tonton des ?les
Mais qui cot? ou ko vin A-P j'crois bien que j'viens des Antilles
A?roport du raijt les vacances sont termin?es
L'avion va d?coller, j'suis le dernier ? embarquer

Truc De Fou 
(Avec Doudou Masta)
?a se passe ? Vitry s/Seine, truc de fou, truc de dingue
L? o? les soirs c'est la m?me, on parle d'argent et de flingue,
Les grandes gueules de Camille Groult Star, s'adressent aux banlieusards
9.8 on fait main basse sur les clefs du pouvoir
Contrebande d'alcool pour fournir les d?put?s qui picolent.
Et avec les c?l?brit?s, on passera des nuits folles
Les juges bosseront pour nous et on sortira nos fr?res de taule.
On va tout rafler, ?a y est fini de squatter les halls.
Maison de skeud, c'est bon, au nom de la 113 productions.
J'fait croquer les m?mes du quartier, m?me s'ils connaissent rien dans le son.
Maintenant j'ai tout ce qu'il faut, mon bureau, ma secr?taire,
Et d?s que j'gal?re j'appelle mes potes pour fumer de la beu-her.
Du bedo, d'la beu-her et des dealers en masse
Sur toutes les places skunk, popo, Afghan et Tha? grasse.
Et si la BAC passe donne-leur un bon 10 sac
Ne cours plus pour ?tre tranquille, faut leur graisser la patte.
J'ai d?cid? de prendre des vacances, faire le tour d'la France.
Abuser en h?tel, casino, sans me soucier de mes d?penses.
Je c?toie des bourgeois, femme d'inspecteur, fille d'avocat
Garde du corps dans le dos, si tu m'approches n'y pense m?me pas.
On contr?le les quarties les bo?tes, les restaurants partout on fait la bringue,
Et on lance sur le march? des grosses voitures de dingues.
On s'en fait plus pour la famille en paix au pays
Je suis devenu tellement big, que je pourrais finir Maire de Vitry.
C'est un truc de fou, de dingue, de psychopathe.
On r?gne dans le monde entier, et les putes sont ? nos pattes.
Finis la gal?re, j'm'inqui?te plus pour mes affaires judiciaires.
Et avec mes fr?res on se pr?pare un avenir prosp?re.
On rosse les mecs du front national ? coups de crosse.
Et le premier qui s'en m?le on l'd?sosse.
Que des trucs de fou dans une France atroce.
Faut r?tablir la peine de mort pour les travs et les pointeurs de gosse.
{Refrain: x2}
Des trucs de fou,
pas des trucs de faux zoulous
Des trucs de dingue
De psychopathe rien ? tre-fou
Les gargeots c'est nous,
Le 113 au rendez-vous
Faites attention, pr?parez-vous!
J'ai le pouvoir, certains l'ont, et d'autres ne l'ont pas.
Moi j'fais partie des gens qui posent gros probl?me ? l'?tat.
Et j'me fais plaisir, j'd?nonce et viole leurs lois.
Je montre du doigt les imposteurs qui se font de l'argent derri?re moi.
Et on fera des r?v?lations dans tous les m?dias.
Des putains d'scandales qui inqi?teront tous les chefs d'?tats.
On a d?cid? d'faire tomber tous les hauts plac?s.
Ainsi que tous les escrocs qui sont en planque ? l'Elys?e.
Jusqu'? la maison blanche en passant par Hollywood.
Je laisserai mes empreintes et mes traces ? la Ghetto Youth.
Puisque la vie est hardcore, je suis sans g?ne ni remords.
Et l?che mes loups sur l'arm?e, qui les cr?veront comme des porcs.
Et des kraks boursiers de Wall Street ? Tokyo
Corruption extorsion de fond, enbref le magot.
J'ferai ?crire 1.1.3 sur tous les lingots.
Et ? nos yeux le plus riche de france sera qu'un vulgaire toxico.
Le borgne en premier, puis on s'occupera du reste.
M?me si sa femme court ? poil avec une batte dans les fesses.
On est psychopates, sortis de l'asile de Camille groult.
O? les r?sidents partent au casse-pipe afin de gagner leurs cro?tes.
Des apparts pour tous les sans abris et tous les clandos.
On br?lera les casiers judiciaires des negros et bicos.
1.1.3 solidaire, Mafia K1 Fry l?gendaire.
Levez vos guns bien haut videz vos chargeurs sur les fachos.
J'fais des trucs de dingue comme un gogol fonced? ? l'alcool.
J'prends le monopole, j'prends mon envol.
J'escroque et tout ? les coups je fuck.
Je me moque, je vis dans mon ?poque.
J'te braque m?me pour du toc.
Appelle-moi le barjeot, le malade qui marche en solo.
Accompagn? de mon calibre, de mon couteau, je te troue la peau.
Un truc de fou, de dingue, de psychopathe.
?a te rentre par les oreilles et ?a te ressort par les pattes.
Ok, c'est doudou masta, un k1 fri de plus ? ri-pas.
J'ai mes fafs fran?ais donc j'fais ce que je veux, j'suis chez moi
Un truc de fou renoi, un truc de fou renoi.

Finie la colonie mais ils nous ont pris pour qui
L'Afrique aux africains laisse toi aller 
Comme une balade sur le fleuve Niger en wax en baza
Peuple riche de culture de tradition 
Modeste travailleur paie l'addition 
Je viens hisser le drapeau vert jaune rouge 
Pour moi de sang et pour que mon peuple bouge 
Je suis ni porte parole ni un exemple 
Mais j'aime ma terre donc je milite 
Je represente (Mali) le souvenir de nos absents (Mali)
Le charme de l'accent de nos parents

De village en village je porte la nouvelle en taxi 
Bronze dans les maisons sur les march?s les pousse pousse

L'enfant se repose au soleil sur l'arbre ? palabre 
C'est vrai que chez moi il n'y a pas la mer

A supid singer sings a stupid song 
He tries to tell you that the night is long 
You know hes lying and you know hes fake 
He order whiskey when you order steak 
Nobody loves him but he dont care 
He doesnt want to come home this year 
And all he wanna do is bleed you dry 
Spin you round until it makes you cry 
He wanna take you back in time 
Back to 1959 
You could go to a drive-in 
You could order an ice-cream 
He wanna takke you back in time 
Back to 1959 
Caress you and hold you 
Just like he told you 
Just ike he told you 
What do you think of when you go to sleep 
Did you forget or not to brush your teeth 
You know that people live inside your mouth 
You know the earth it settles in the south 
Your skin is soft - it feels so nice 
You gotta friend in Jesus Christ 
2000 years ago he died for you 
You got a nail thru your adidas shoe 
He wanna take you back in time....

Boy Meet Girl 
Hey, Im awake whats that scent in the air
Do I know this place from before
I wonder where all of my shoes dissapear
Just some traces of dirt on the floor
Does anyone here have some water to spare
Cause I woke with this terrible thirst
Its the romantic notion of harshness to share
Before my testicles burst
Boy meet girl they fall in love
I watch the scene from up above
The angels are gone where angels go
Hell, I dont know
If these angels are real could they follow me home
And reward me for putting my trust
In this bed as the mark of my journey to roam
Thru the nights of obedient lust
I am battered to pieces by vodka and sex
And a fondness for odious sin
I eep making phone-calls at night to my ex
And I wish for her scent on my skin
Boy meet girl they fall in love
I watch the scene from up above
The angels are gone where angels go
Hell, I dont know

Girl With The Clandestine Heart 
I used to love a girl caled Mary-Jane
I used to think that people looked the same
Without their heads on
But then she made my sky complete
I used to watch her fall asleep
I used to kiss her lie the salty sea
I used to think that we where wild and free
So independent
But like buildings people fall apart
Shes the girl with the clandestine heart
She used to tell me things Ive never heard
It made me raise my head just like a bird
When it drinks water
I swore to love her til the end of time
But when I turned around she wasnt mine
I shouldve seen it
I shouldve known it from the start
Shes the girl with the clandestine heart

Its the kindness of strangers
And the absence of harm

And his friendly charm
Hes got a headful of liquor
And a fistful of grass

Of the white middle-class
He do the crazy handstand
He do the funny ape
He do the rocknroll band
He do the total fake
He want the dolphin flip
Adidas handball-shoe
Around the moon and back hit
He do the I love you
Hes got a headful of liquor
And a fistful of hasch
Hes still watching the sky
For the two-seven clash
He is the space invader
Hes a sex machine
He is the caped crusader
Hes a strangers dream

Everything fall apart
Even the strongest heart, part
In the millenium fever
It gets better in 1000 years
Stay in here
Got the millenium stare
Millenium fever
The road remain the same
Heal the lame, millenium shame
The I-dont-care fever
Go nowhere, play with the old toys
In the sauna with the jack-off boys
Ugly cowboys
Theres no need to save the world
Theres no need to save the world
The world is just fine
But the people needs saving
>From the turn of the time
The Millenium craving
Millenium fever
The sign and the descent
The dollar, the cent, the corrupt government
Millenium fever
Turn the engine off, hear the sound
Of the buzzing sky, the silent ground
No-one around
Millenium fever
The anastethic scream
Burn the mind to heal the dream or so it seem
Millenium fever
Dont believe the things you see
The crack, the smack, the LSD
The you and me
Theres no need to save the world...

No After, No Before 
She smells like vanilla
Her mom's from Manilla
It is dark and you walk down the street
You're propped full of dope
Feel like Julian Cope
And you wanna go someplace to eat
She talks, you don't listen
Something 'bout her sisters
It is fall and the trees have turned red
And you don't like her looks
And she doesn't read books
And sometimes you just wish she was dead
You just don't love her anymore
There's no after, no before
There is no sunshine in a fog
And love is a place where dog eat dog
So you start to ignore her
Like all the girls before her
And you hope she will leave by herself
But you're stuck in a spiral
And fear is your rival
He shows up when you're by yourself
So you worry and weep
'til you doze off to sleep
And you dream about her face in the sky
But you can't make a sound
And you're stuck to the ground
'cause even in dreams you can't fly
You just don't love her anymore...

Wouldnt that be a shame

You might live in Kansas City
You might live in sin
You might leave me far behind
Or change me from within
Heres another song about you
Its not something I want to
Its just something that I do
And I could kill you right now
Wouldnt that be a shame

Blockstyle Murderah 
* [Taydatay]
Stack chips like Don Trump
Comin' wit the slump
So original head bustas
Makin' moves from the junk
Mashin' niggas [???]
We stay loaded, fully loaded
Let the game be noted
We only comin' wit the coldest, hold up
In '99 we breakin' 'em off wit major heat
Sweepin' the industry off they feet
Hypnotize 'em wit the beats
It's the most hated, America's most blunted
See niggas come from the bottom
Then we turn around and run it
Comfront it, we got cha
Hollow points in the chamber
Releasin' the anger
Fuckin' around get caught up in the caper
People stoppin' my paper
Ain't no time for no games
I'm watchin' niggas catch the vapors
While I'm doin' my thang
I hit the back and I swang
Niggas and bitches they be jockin'
They wanna floss wit us
Cuz they know we 'bout the lock and load
We warmed up for the score
'Bout to hit 'em wit a little bit of hardcore
[Chorus] x 2
Cuz in my lifetime I'd a done gang of shit
Invloved wit 211's, 187's for the chills
Another blockstyle murderah
Another blockstyle murderah
We 'bout to have it bitch

And since I was a itty bitty niggy on the corner
I was a performer
Now my music gets women through California
Love to get up on it
We disinigrate all opponents
And represent niggas, windows tinted
Till you can't [??]
It's the O to the fuckin' A-K
D to the A-L-D
Fuck what the haters say, we paper chase
So you can't tell me a muthafuckin' thang
But the [?]
We [?] too much blood gushers
Cuz you ain't the one that run the hood
We [?] from the goods
Like they say, "Talk is cheap"
Oh yeah, they workin' the tech
So you get swepped up off your feet
Now break up off of me, heard me
In the game
I'm a fill the lane like I'm James Worthy
Hella slurvy
Yes indeedy that's your boy
That would keep the backpack
And the clack-clack, you be destroyed
You shouldn't have never got me pumped
And now your soul is full of holes
They've come to mop him up
Cuz I was sloppy drunk
And had to pop him up
[Chorus] x 2
[Hennessy]
It's just the flossamatic, caught the cabbage
Nigga what, in the cuts, get no bumps
Till my pockets got the mumps
And when they jump
We let them cats off
But we take yo head off
Wit a [?], no explination, no hesitation
Nigga just smash on
But 'for the chance was smooth
And all the work, yo ass was through
Hoppin' fences, coherant distance while we passin' through
I'm here to let you know boy
We get the [?]
When you fuckin' wit them snow boys
And makin' more noise
[Taydatay]
You know
Cuz we be flippin' the script
On top wit big faces
Known in hella places
Illutin' all the drug cases
Fuck the basics, we goin' all out
We got to show these muthafuckas what the Sco be about
You got to follow your route,
Follow your route, follow your route
Cuz without the paper
Niggas gon' be assed out
I'm talkin' word of mouth
I said, "You in it for the whores"
You know my Hunter's point niggas be straight hard

Garcia Vegas 
Jeah, another Tay da Tight hit
11/5's in the motherfuckin house (4x)
Well I started off a hustla indo smokin
Weed in my lungs so a nigga kept chokin
Eyes kinda red blood shot from the contact
In a 67' Caddy bumpin Gap Band eight track
What you say nigga 11/5's in the house
So let me break it down what us niggas all about
As I step to the scene I got some bitches on the nuts
But I act like a pimp so I don't give a fuck
Step back get back stand in line
You gotta get yours bitch I gotta get mine
It's TaydaTay now can I get a fader
Who got half on the weed and the Vegas?
Players listen before the hoes bounce
I gotta get drunk off a 64 ounce
You can say 800
Got the weed rolled up so it's time to get blunted
Chorus: 
Everybody light your Vega, 
everybody light your Vega, 
everybody smoke, woo hoooo (2x)
Well I'm not braggin everybody's passin
All they weed to me
But the dank ain't enough so I'm hittin all night
To cop a cold M.D.
What up step back and get wasted
Weed in the air I can almost taste it
Take it hit it pass it to a friend
Then you mix it light it quick with the motherfuckin gin
Ooh we bitch now I'm feelin tight
But that's how you doin it when you off dank right
High as a kite I can touch the fuckin sky
But I'm stuck like Chuck and I won't even try
Over high, eleven five
I've been smokin all day you can tell from my eyes
Smoke in my lung you can feel it in my chest
Just copped another gram now guess what's next
Chorus
Now first let's call for the motherfuckin indo
Pull out your crutch and put away your pistol
Nigga this is Frisco bitch I got the bomb
When you're in a rush break it down in your palm
If you ain't got ten you can give a nigga eight
Fade with ya niggas then you browse thru the Point (?)
Pick up the bitch and you put her in the back
But you better have your gat if the ho is a hoodrat (Jeah)
All hoes on the life I lead
I can't function right without a gram of weed indeed
I like to smoke to get high
And I won't stop til the day a nigga die
Anytime anyplace I'm gonna do it like Janet
Tryin to get high with the whole damn planet
I'm a smoke by myself if I can't get a fader
But I won't roll shit without a Garcia Vega 
(Vega, Vega, Vega, Vega)

Hate To See Me Have Shit 
* [Maine-O]
Nigga I'm from the projects
Now pack my check
And I demand respect
You plan a place and get checked
And I'll make your t-shirt wet
See I'm that fed up out the Sco nigga
A pro nigga
What you mean that's all you got
Get your ass on the floor nigga
Move faster if you have to
And if you ain't got what I'm knockin'
Mutha fucka I'm attempt to get me
The convo before I go Joe Blow
I'm robbin' niggas for they doe
And hittin' the cuts and lay low
I'll spray your whole block up
And everybody's gettin' popped up
Nobody got up
Because you bitches all got shot up
Block up my nina, fuckin' supina'd
I'm not goin' back to jail
I'm blastin' niggas to hell
And if I fail then I'm all in
But at least wit a piece
I can release when I'm a star bitch
Cuz I'm a Northern Cali killa
Stack still, a cap pilla
I got dealers stackin' skrilla from jackin' niggas
Chorus: x2 [Hennessy]
Niggas rather see me blasted
I lay dead in the casket
To see me lavage
But I ain't havin' it
The gas pedal I be mashin'
To escape the assassin
Cuz mutha fuckas hate to see me have shit
[Hennessy]
It's time to smash the gas pedal
Openin' off 4-4 barrels
Wit my strap in my lap
Cuz these mutha fuckas jealous
Cuz I drinkin' brews
Wit my man dressed in blue
Top notches on my jock
Tryin' to choose cuz I make it move
That's why I'm 4 deep
Drunk off the Olde E
And if you got beef
Lets hate banger's to the goatee
These scandalous ass bitches
Is just as bad as these niggas
And niggas could get riches
So that these bitches roll in benz's
My business on the hump like R
Wit my windows smoke tinted
So you can't see up in my car
Callin' shots on niggas life's
Like I'm Jesus Christ and uh
Thou shall not grind without kickin' in mine
Cuz time after time they're back
Game scattered like roaches
They be victims of my sickness
Cuz I'm vicious when it's slowly
I'm the nigga bitch
And best believe there's no mistakin'
Cuz these other niggas fakin'
Like they're makin' what I'm makin' nigga
[Chorus] x2
[Taydatay]
Sort of like a psycho
Fuck no, a lunatic
I'm ready to do some dirt
Because I'm deep up that bullshit, wit 45
Different ways to express
These eleven  hollow points  
Into yo mutha fuckin' chest
Who wanna test
That criminal minded nigga bustin' like a savage
All for the love of the cabbage
When I see it, I got to have it
Fuck a ho, and milk a bitch
That be the way
Cuz they hate to see me lavage
Makin' money, gettin' paid on the regular
No hesitations for my filla, realla  
Cuz a nigga illa for the skrilla
Peel yo cap back
And creep like a mutha fuckin' menace
And witness as I jack and bounce wit the quickness
Stack the money in the safe
Rendezvous wit the click
Think of Mr. Make-A-Mil
I'm the mutha fuckin' shit
It's so drastic
And keep away from niggas who be blastin'
And hatin' on a nigga  
Cuz they hate to see me have shit

Act Out 
(feat. Thi'sl)
[Verse One]
I'm loving life fam, we in the light man
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
We get it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Jesus the headliner, I'm just his hypeman
So get it right fam, It's not about your boy
But if you get the truth, holla at ya boy fam
My past was gritty and filthy like a trashcan
But through His blood, I'm cleaner than a snowman
This not a show man, but this for show man
At his wedding, he saved me for a slow dance
so I'm gon slow dance, down and narrow wit em
The whole way fam, like I'm hearing slow jamz
I sold program, this is program
Out wit the old man, in wit the new man
Follow the trails he left us like TuCan
Sam, 1 and 2, this one is for you fam
[Chorus]
If you walking down the streets
Or you ridin' wit yo top down
Reppin' on the front line
A soldier in the background
You face the trials of this world
And you don't back down
You hear the word of the Lord
And go and act out
You get down to the fathers biz
Want the whole world to know who Jesus is
If you loving the fact that Jesus lives
And the fact that Jesus is, Act Out
[Verse Two]
Let's keep it hype man, I'm just a hypeman

Like the Psalm that says word we delight man
Rejoice and we write man, all about Christ fam
Let's keep it moving
Don't get it tangled in everyday life, keep your focus on God's plan
Forsake the world's plan and the things that covet

The plans for us is to shed light like a summer man
Before cats get knock-ed off like duh duh man
[Chorus]

Yea that's right man, this that Christ Jam

Whether you walking down the street or at a light man
Sittin' in your room, about to make a right man

Keep your focus on God's plan
Because our life suppose to bring light man
To lead people out of the dark to the God man

Breathe In Breathe Out 
(feat. Lecrae)
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
[Chorus]
Breathe In
Take it in slow, let it work up in your soul
Take ya time and let it grow before you blow
Breathe Out
Let 'em know what you about from the words in your mouth
To the way you live it out no doubt
[Verse One]
Don't rock don't pop don't drop don't move
Just listen real close to what I'm trying to tell you
Its probably something different than what your used to
So let me break it down so the truth don't miss you
I learned a little bible was ready to take off
Armed with the truth but dropped the grace off
When everybody see me they ready to break off
I said to myself "Oh well, just stay lost"
Breathe In
But wouldn't take the word in slow
Lost the context that I heard before
Wouldn't meditate on the word I just go
Forget a commentary I got to save souls
They say wisdom is better than silver and gold
But I skipped that verse and I hit the door
Man they couldn't tell me nothing
Thought that I was on to something
And I was running all directions
Just a brother trying to gun it
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
I was telling folks I know the spirit got my back
But I never picked the word up and read the facts
It was on now, I was in the zone now
Jesus had twelve well I was on my own now
People leave me alone now
Bout to get it gone now
But I fell flat upon my face I'm all alone now
Didn't have the truth in my sling
I was just trying to wing it
If it sound good I'm gonna say I'm gonna mean it
If its in the bible thats cool, I believe it
But I ain't really study so I couldn't really see it
See man you got to believe man
Now I breathe in, breathing out is so easy
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Last verse but I got a lot more to say
Got a partner named Jay from around the way
Breathe out all day but he wouldn't breathe in
He give the seed out but he wouldn't read man
And he told me theology was for them birds
And he really didn't need it when he read the word
Look left, Look right for a sign from God
But he didn't know the word was inspired by God
Telling people bout a couple funny things he heard
But the things that he heard they ain't match the word
If they don't match the word well they ain't true
Cause the bible is the final say on the things we do
I said Jay now, I understand how you feel
Man I love your zeal but you probably want to chill
He said Crae now, you can read all day
But I'm just a little different man that ain't my way
So I told him, how the word of God was true
How Paul was a Jew who would use the truth
of the Old Testament to make things clear
Thank God that day Jay turned an ear
Now he reading, reading, and reading the word
And his life look like what he see in the word
Matter of fact he don't ever want to leave the word
I'm trying to tell y'all that boy breathe the word!
[Chorus]
Now check this out y'all
I want y'all to keep it holy man
I know this beat sounds like one of them beats
That make you want to do something
You ain't got no business doing
You know what I'm saying, check it out
But lets try something a little different
Let me see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now

Fanataics 
(feat. Lecrae)
[Chorus]
I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic
I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God whose extremely great
I'm a Fanatic
[Verse One]
The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin
but only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin
And they fate look grim, If they don't take him
As the high priest he is to mediate they sin
The world's got to many Gods, man we choose the one
From hebrews, he rules, he bruised his son
He moves the sun
So if we prayin and our schools call us fools
Cuz our God's too true to shun
Channels two in one
Man it looks insane
TV make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as one and same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us
but we gon' follow our God wherever the bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hate while you at it, take a look at our mathematics
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied himself and let out sin hang him
You couldn't blame him for any sin
While they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
We are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on TV who glorifying their bishop
From Edwards to Piper, MacAurther to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, From Cali to Berlin
As Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us as evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing out faith
But thats cool, we can carry the weight of persecution
Cuz earth is losing
And if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
So keep it moving
Cuz if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
They thought Jesus was out of his mind
they laughed and mocked him
Called him a cult leader and they tried to stop him
Pharisees said Christ got his power from Satan
Hatin', on the very one that came to save 'em
Even after he rose, man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
and, "it don't take all that to be a Christian man"
And its hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff
They say man, "you too spiritual, you doing to much"
So we show them the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win if we're rejected because of his name
We win if seeds get planted and watered and grow
But even if we lost, we still be Fanatical though

Verse 1:
You catch us in the long T's, fitted hats, it ain't suits that we wearin'.
Well how can we tell you Christian?  'Cause the fruit that we bearin'.
See, a seed was planted that produced salvation, we're filled with the spirit so we the bear the fruit of Galatians, man (c'mon!).
And when you see us, we ain't unwrappin' them switches (nope), we've been given the sack of forgiveness, we crakin' them scriputures, man (wooh!).
So you gonna notice we gonnna post with our life (post with our life!).
We stand on the word with boldness, 'cause we soldiers for Christ (we soldiers for Christ!)!
Look, we something like them dudes from 116.
We ain't ashamed, forget one mic, give me one more script (but I ain't ashamed!).
So I can begin to take the truth to the block.
Uproot the dudes that been duped, 'cause you can get loose on your rock (can get loose on your rock!).
But move to the rock, believe me, the truth'll hold ya.
We're wet with the living water, like a Super Soaker (a Super Soaker).
Who can hold us back?  It's a group of soldiers.
Lone on the Holy Ghost so you can lose the dozier (c'mon, c'mon!).
Chorus:
We ain't drinkin' licker (nope!)!
We ain't blowin' trees (uh-uh!)!
Our life has been surrendered (yep)!
We want to know he's pleased (c'mon!)!
But you might see us with the Cross on the block.
Posted, shining like diamonds, 'cause we glossin' the rock!  C'mon! (x2)

Takin' the gospel across the globe, the book of Acts is clurr (yep!).
Man, God is all around like the atmosphurr (fo sho!).

Impressed 
(feat. Tedashii)
[Tedashii]
ALL RISE, for the coming of the king of the Jews
Sixteen saints salute for Him bringin the truth
Hold up for a minute put your focus on Him
The selah for a second to catch more than a glimpse
Of the one placed higher than the angels in heaven
Pre-eminent so dawg that means He never comes second
Nothing should ever replace or overshadow this God
Ever reduce or lower his position as God
Man, He's holy, plus diving with all splendor
It's time Jesus Christ became your life's true center
The focus of your life so that your life be permanent
Pause
And peep this God that made the world and the firmament
Man, I'll put this on my momma, He'll blow that mind
Watch as I paint the picture for ya, its kodak time
If you ever wondered who He was, then no that now
No interruption take the sweets and heats and throw that down
[Chorus]
How can you hear about this God dawg and not get impressed?
The one that gave the sky its height and the ocean its depth
The one that hung all of the planets plus the moon and the sun
And let you hear this song that you might commune with the Son
[Tedashii]
So tell me what you seeing when you looking at God
Is it Yahweh the indescribable, unspeakable God
Or dawg, is it Elohim, all sovereign and majestic
The provident creator with a six day checklist
Or maybe the King of Kings up on the side of the Father
With nail prints in his hands cuz He decided to bother
Or do you look and see someone who ain't no better than you
Well if you the focus dawg I suggest you better your view
How you gon' act like you compare to Him?
You don't compare to the seraphim that cherish Him
Man, you got two lungs that still need air in them
The bottom line dawg, when you looking at God
You should see the king of glory not a midst or a fog
Not Father Time with the long beard and clock
and not this passive Jesus Walks that you hear in hip hop
But the God of the Bible Isaiah saw in Chapter 6
Who got a glimpse and said "God is Holy, I need to repent"
[Chorus]
[Tedashii]
Man, I've been looking for a minute how we impressed with things
Plus ourself, so we came to address this thing
We came to rep Him so dawg you would bless the King
And be impressed like Froto was with the ring
Like the Phanatik, take time dawg and think on these things
Think about how you're a sinner and you need to be clean
We sons of Adam fallen sinners and deserve to be killed
Man, we couldn't keep the standard cuz perfection His will
He is coming back for all of the cats
That allowed Christ to be they ransom and satisfy God's wrath
But, we'd rather think the bible's all about us
Instead of Jesus whom God said put all of your trust
Man stop coming up to God cuz you think He'll bless ya
Man stop coming up to God cuz you want something extra
Its time he impressed ya, and not because of all that He's done
But because of who He is dawg the Glorious One

In Ya Hood 
(feat. Tedashii, Trip Lee)
[Chorus]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood
[Verse One]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood
I'll never stop what I'm doing
Grooving moving for Jesus
Steady grindin in the streets just to reach all of my peoples
Momma, daddy, sister, brother, uncle, cousin and them
It's time we get it in for Jesus, start a buzz up for him
Man, but somethings always stopping ya, maybe your love for sin
Or the lack of love you showing when you cursing at men
Man how holy is he to you, how impressed by him are you
Is your life a story all about him or dawg does it star you
The answers your actions, the fruit of your passions
Plus the prove of the facts and who it is that you casting
Make a switch, change your role
116 became the mold
The word to the Colossians to know God is in control
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
Hey dawg its T-dot, coming from the street block
Just to rep the chief rock, cause I think that he's not
In the place where he's got the chief spot
In ya life like the top
Cause life is all headed for the end like the sign that reads stop
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
You breathe in breathe out, then its back to the dirt
The fact of the earth is life is nothing more than vain glory
Your born, you suffer, you die, it's the same story
So come on dawg get closer to the life of this teacher
The preacher, savior, creator, our lord, king, and our leader
Of this holy culture movement, man we might insult when
You hear that to make it in you gotta go through him
Your a sinner, he's the Savior, your created, He's creator
But no matter how you spin it, you gone have to meet the maker
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
It goes love, joy, hope and peace
My motivation for the ministry while hitting the streets
Man, we aliens, souled out on a mission fishing for heathens
Representing the kingdom, I'm praying that this truth can reach them
Like a telegram message that was sent through the wire
Or a Pauline Epistle thats divinely inspired
Cause all men need Jesus just like air to your lung
So in order to truly live dawg I dare you to come
Stop trying to do it yourself like McNabb on the run
Cause no man is worthy enough to compare to the Son
Or foot the bill for our sin that no money can pay
So all your good works now are worthless without faith
And, only Jesus Christ can truly free Pimp C
Even if he get up out of prison dawg he still ain't free
So remember without him we're a heartbeat from hell
Confess the name and rep him well before your heartbeat fails

I See The Lord 
(feat. Sho)
[Verse One]
Cast down my crown to worship you in spirit and truth
As I see You on the throne, I see Your train fills the roof
I'm on bended knees, hands extended closed eyes
Holy, Holy, Holy is Lord the Most High
Woe is me, I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people whose on the same trip
That when one Seraphim flew to me with coal in his hands
He touch me on my lips, said I was a brand new man
As the foundation shook He's asking, who shall He send
I said, "Send me Lord, I commit to faithful men"
Sometimes Lord, I feel like I don't give you enough
The kind of pure joy to persevere when times get tough
So I keep a concentrated relationship fixed on you
I keep my eyes to the hills so I can have a right view
I stand in awe of You
How You measured the earth with the palm of Your hand
and yet, and still you want to be friends with such an unclean man
So like John I fall prostrate on this island of life
I worship You, recognizing you are power and might
Glory and light, eternal in sight, blameless and right
Creator of life, thief in the night, Jesus the Christ
[Chorus]
I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalted
And the train of His robe, fills the temple with glory
And the whole earth is filled, and the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled, with His glory
[Verse Two]
The sun suspends in the air
I can feel Your winds everywhere
You care to the grains of my hair
Divine works all around me
I can't get past the evidence
The fact that your invisible, to me, is irrelevant
I know your heaven sent, straight to the virgin birth
Gave me a second chance even after man's curse
A third, a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth
You wore my crown of thorns, you took my licks as they spit
In ya face, off the cross a sinner you embraced
Now I understand whats the meaning of grace
I war against the flesh, can't wait till the day that you come
Cause everday I'm rewriting Psalm 51
From the weak to the dumb
You make us shine like Pearls
Got a new engagement, broke up with that girl named world
The relationship was unfruitful, I was Satan's pupil
They told me you was an unfair God, I believed those lies
I know the truth now, cuz you've been fair since creation
Man fell, and then you gave man emancipation
I know the saying one sin can make man fall
But with one drop of blood, he can save us all
I'm a living sacrifice, I lay my life upon the altar
I pray to have faith that don't forsake you, like a martyr
I have a desire, thats to know you more
I have no choice to live holy cuz I see the Lord
[Chorus]
[Isaiah 6]
For Whole earth is full of his glory
And the foundations of the threshold tremble
At the voice of him who called out
While the temple is filled with smoke
I said to myself Woe is me
For I am ruined
Because I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people with unclean lips
For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of Hosts
Then one seraphim flew to me
With burning coals in his hand
He touched me on my lips
Said my iniquity is taken away, and my sins forgiven
Then I heard the voice of the Lord say
Who shall I send?
Who will go for us
Then I said
Here I am, Send Me

Love Song 
Where would I be if I never met your love
Can't imagine ever gettin up
Without knowin your grace how you placed me in your righteousness
I can't get enough
Unconditional love is what you show me
In a world so cold and lonely
And the life that I'm livin was givin not based on me
But based on the fact you know me
You... interceeded on my behalf
You... gimme everything that I have
You... never leave me alone my sins I been told
Cause you can no longer take on my wrath
You been so true so faithful
For your word I'm so grateful
Your love is true
And not what they showing on cable, and I'm
So in love with your righteousness I fight to just
Keep you in my sight for just
Five seconds of my life since the day I met Christ
Never knew a love quite like this, I'm writin this
With tears on my face you was there for my grace
Cause a father wouldn't hear my case
I was dead in my sins but you bled for my sins
That's the best kind of love anybody can taste
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love
Verse 2 Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Love me Lord you sho do
I done lied and cheated and cheated and lied
And treated the lies as if they was true but
Metaphorically you broke my legs
Like a sheppard does his sheep when it misbehaves
Not to hurt me but to work me
Into the man that you need me to be today, And it's sweet to say
Even when I'm doin back I'm good
Work for the Lord I'm glad I could
Tell me you would give the son and die for the sins of the world
My daddy would
That's a love like no other
Not my father not my mother not my sister not my brother nope not at all
Forget material things, I got every spiritual blessing in Christ
Eternal life, ya I got it all
Fall deeper in love with u everyday
No longer there so I know you hear me when I pray
And you show me your wisdom in many ways
66 books to keep me amazed
Only your heavenly love can manifest
In the death and resurrection
Your affection is sheer perfection
Divine election, you give me direction
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love can save somebody just like me
Was tempted just like me
But never gave in unlike me
I'm blown away
I never understood the kinda love that
Make somebody die for our world
Who doesn't even care that you cry for the world
Who doesn't care that you gave your life for the world
We do you dirty Lord, we not worthy Lord
Of your goodness and your mercy Lord
It hurts me that we remain to flirt with life that we got, to my Christ
So earthy Lord
Your love you know it rains
One day we'll see it plain
That to live as Christ and to die is gain
So keep all the fortune forget the fame man
We need the love of Jesus
Ha, that name Jesus
I could say it all day, I be in a daze
Your love is amazin like man Jesus
Your love's true and sincere
I reference you in fear
And as long as I'm around I'm down
To make sure the peopl hear
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love with everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love

Streets 
(feat. Lecrae, BJ, Tedashii)
[Chorus]
Hey we bring this to the street
Cause they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street
Cause it's mean up in the street
We're redemmed of the street
That used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched
By the scene of the streets
[Verse One]
Hey, this ain't aimed at the church but you might be incouraged
This is for the folks hurt on the block with the word
See ya playing in the dirt, hoping you can get the bird
Steady sippin on your syrup, wit a dutch full of burb
Let me tell ya what's gon happen dawg, this is why I'm rappin dawg
You catch time for the crime and then ya trappin dawg
Oh what's worse, is it could be your hers
6 feet up in the dirt, got yo baby brother hurt
Yea, a worse still when you die, gets real
You eternally separated from God for a trillian
Million, billion eternaty mayne
Ain't no number for it, this should be concerning ya mayne
Look, ya can't sleep cause ya sin so heavy
Ya sweating in ya sheets cause ya sin so heavy
Ready to die, naw, dawg, you ain't ready
You don't truely know what's on the other side young revin
Is sin equals death, so turn from your mess, believe and confess
Christ is God in the flesh, he died for your debt, he did resurrect
A tool and a vest won't really save you from death
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
They never saw us coming, they had they heads turned
We faced the persecution, we know the led burns
We know them nails hurt, we know them thorns scared
We know our futures bright, but it ain't in the stars
We a new generation, who know the worlds hurts
And though we don't rock suits, we still part of the church
Our souls hurt too, our burdens hurt too
We want the Lord to be gloryfied on the earth too
We wearing dickies, yeah, but we still know the bible
We yelling like David was, ready to start revival
I know some kids in Dallas still in Jr. High
They ain't tryin to pimp girls, push work, or get high
Yea they jeans hangin low, and they keep they hat cop
But they living by the word instead of living by the block
Gettin trained a disciple, they changed all they idols
From juves in the streets to the God of the bible
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
We done redemmed of the streets that used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched by the scene of the streets
So we bring this to the street, they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street, cause it's mean up in the street
Chasin cream up in the street, servin feinds up in the street
And the scream that they see makes them feind what they see
To be the man of the street, that's why we stand in the street
To tell the whole world about the stand of the peace
The god man of the street, slian lamb for the street
That came and died for all the sinfull people in the street
Through him the cycle of the street when man rival in the street
Could be revival in the street, take the bible to the street
Cause his bride should be the street, stop trying to be discret
Why you lunging men and women steady dying in the street
So we pray up in the street, man we stay up in the street
Cause we find our God heart, man it pains for the street

12 Meses Del ALo 
Mi vieja siempre me decia, la vida es como un juego
Los 365 dias del aLo ,los 12 meses, las 8,760 horas
De esos 365 dias un juego de la memoria a diferencia
De los animales de la selva que actuan, trabajan o
Respoden por instinto somos los unicos animales que
Actuamos ,por memoria y es que sin memoria mi hermano
No se puede vivir, anyway cada cual, decide como jugar
El juego de la vida cada cual que bregue con su tiempo
Y con su memoria...
En enero vi a todo el mundo con sus resoluciones sus
SueLos y con sus promesas de cambios vi como una madre
Divorciada tenia 2 empleos para lograr mantener a sus
Hijos y sacarlos a flote tambien a vi como mi pueblo
Poco a poco hiba perdiendo la tradicion de los
3 santos reyes.
En febrero vi como personas celebraban el dia de san
Valentin y se regalaban flores y chocolates cuando
Durante todo el aLo han sido hipocritas los unos con
Los otros.
En marzo, vi como una seLora le dispararon 12 veces
Para rovarle la gua gua, pero tambien vi como un niLo
De 7 aLos salvava a su madre en un accidente
Automovilistico.
En abril vi como confinados de una carcel del pais
Se amotinaron por las malas condiciones y el acinamiento
Y tambien vi como un ser humano se desangro frente a un
Hospital por la falta de empleados y equipo.
En mayo vi como un padre orgulloso por que su hijo
Se graduaba de cuarto aLo con honores habia sido
Admitido a una universidad en el extranjero.
Y Junio y Julio los meses de veranos unque no me crean
Fui a mDs funerales que a festivales playeros y vi a
Madres llorando en la funeraria, coronas y derramando
Lagrimas de cocodrilos...
La calle esta mala mi hermano...
En agosoto vi como las clases comensaron y vi,escuelas
No tenian libros, vi chamaquitos sin uniformes maestros
Descontentos un sistema educativo completamente inselvible.
Yo vi miedo..
En septiembre vi un hombre que acesino a su esposa y se
Suicido dejando a sus hijos huerfanos,
Tambien vi un funcionario del gobierno que era
Encarcelado por cargos de corupcion.
En octubre vi como una familia era desauciada de su casa
Construido en terrenos del gobierno, vi como un vecisno
Mio era despedido de su trabajo por razones politicas,
En noviembre vi como una familia celebraba el dia de
AcciNn de gracias con una oculenta cena cuando
Deverian de dar gracias a Dios son todos los dias
Cuando vi diambulantes no tenian na que comer
Nada por que celebrar y en diciembre cuando algunos
Estaban celebrando vi una madre preocupada por que
No tenia dinero para comprarle regalos a sus hijos
Y vi otra madre llorando por que era la primera navidad
Sin su hijo acesinado y en el fin de aLo mientras
Los petaldos sonaban vi a un niLo en el suelo
Desangrandose por culpa de una bala perdida
Personas preparandose para comensar el nuevo aLo
El mismo cuento distintios dias.
Este fue un leve resumen de los 12 meses de un aLo
De 356 dias y con el pasar de los meses me eh dado
Cuenta que pertenezco a la raza mas violenta del planeta
Y asi como un tigre no mata otro tigre nosotros deveriamos
Tomar el ejemplo y no matarnos los unos a los otros
Asi que lucha comparte y vive en armonia este es
Gallego en los 12 Discipulos.

Censurame Por Ser Rapero 
Yo! Ja!

Tirando la verdad!
Dirigido...
Pa' esa gente de la alta sociedad!
Jaja!
O mejor dicho...
De la alta suciedad!
Je!
E-D-D-I-E!
Muchos me miran como si yo fuera un tipo sin arreglo
Como si nunca antes hubieran visto un negro
Como si fuera un delincuente
Como si con el lapiz y con mi libreta yo matara gente
Y cuando me asomo
Hay un par que lo piensan pa' darme plomo
Pues tengo que joderme pa' que mi noticia sea publicada
Y si mato a alguien, rapido me dan toas' las portadas
Y no me mires mal, cuida tu actitud
Yo solo soy un portavoz de la juventud
Un guerrero ante la adversidad
Y soy mejor que la mitad de la Universidad
Y cuando arranco, no tengo pausa
No importa si me dicen, rebelde sin causa
Firme como piedra
Y confio mas en un tecato de Santurce
Que en un juez de Monte Hiedra
Tal vez mi musica no sea sana
Pero yo no me invente ni el sexo ni la marihuana
Pal carajo los que nos critican
Esta es la musica con que los jovenes se identifican
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
A mi no me importa, si te gusto o si te disgusto
Pues mi diploma de 4to aLo esta firmao' por un corrupto
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
No me hables de lo justo ni de lo injusto
Pues, mi diploma esta firmao' por un corrupto
La gente quiere hacer un issue de una cosa tonta
Sera por eso que tenemos tanta gente en contra
Como los del Senado
Pero es bien facil hablar mierda sentado
En aire acondicionado
Como puLeta vo'a hacer algo positivo?
Si todo lo que veo es negativo
Si hablo mis vivencias
Dicen que promuevo la violencia
Ppor lo visto la democracia es a conveniencia
Nos han puesto un sello, pero
La mayoria de nosotros somos mas gente que ellos
Diganme, a que rapero de esta Isla
Lo han acusao' de las puercas que han acusao' a Misla
Y hay tiraera en mis canciones
Pero no tanto como en la campaLa de las elecciones
Se acusan de corrupto, el otro dice que esta mal
Y total, al final, terminan robando igual
Hacen promesas pa' tu vecindario
Cuando ganan nunca vuelven por tu barrio
Por eso no confio, soy un tipo listo
Mi voto solo se lo doy a Jesucristo
Y esto es pa' los que se pican, los que se agitan
Los que nos utilizan cuando necesitan
Y aunque me salga caro lo que disparo
Voy a seguir enviando el mensaje claro
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
A mi no me importa, si te gusto o si te disgusto
Pues mi diploma de 4to aLo esta firmao' por un corrupto

Enguandome las bolas estuve como una hora pa sacame to'a la sal
Mi lado una muchacha en bikini y borracha k tambien se iba a enguagar
Al notar k yo era wiso tiro la toalla al piso y se dobla sin pensar
Yo me puse a mirarle la nalgota y la chochota y esas dos grandes tetas
Con el frio y con la brisa casi casi me hipnotiza la cabrona taba quebra
Acabo de enguagarme, sacudirme y de secarme y empiezo a caminar
Yo voy rascandome las bolas frente a mi una culona jalandose la colilla
Cansado de la playa algo me jala la toalla no sabia k era
Yo pense que era una palga habia sido que una palma se me habia quedao encajaa
Cambiando el tema vuelvo pa la nena (x4)
Bajate el pantalon subete la mini,
Quiero ver tu g-string o tu bikini
La ke tenga panty e vieja ke lo tire a wipi
Mientra nosotros los maliante nos fumamo un filling
Asi ke cojan el idioma ke mejor dominen

Supuestamente ahora todo es diferente,
Y le venden a la gente,
Que el prejuicio quedo a la izquierda.

Se creen que ganan mucho al aconsejarnos,
Sin saber que ganarJan mucho mas al escucharnos.
Djenme vivir,

Y si en verdad gente quiere que yo cambie no me reproche.
Mejor ore por mJ en las noches.

Yo no me humillo ante los gringos.
Ni me cogieron con setenta kilos en Santo Domingo.
Ni me invente los cigarrillos ni los wisky.
Ni puse a mamar a Monica Lewinsky.
Yo no trato a los pobres como animales.
Ni dejo morir la gente en hospitales.
Yo no mande boricuas pa' donde Husein.
Ni le dije rata a Freddy ValentJn.
Yo no vote por ___.
Ni le dije a los policJas que esnuaran a la menor en la celda.
Yo no le robe la tierra a los tainos.
Ni le niego los papeles a los latinos.
Yo no cerr ni el ___ ni el \"hawaian\".
Ni le presenta la nena a Kobe Bryant.
Yo no mezclo la leche con la magnesia.
Ni manipulo las personas en la iglesia.
Yo nunca he dicho que la juventud esta perdida.
Ni le robe el dinero al instituto del sida.
Yo no caso parejas del mismo sexo.
Ni maltrato las visitas de los presos.
Si de algo soy culpable,
Es de vivir sin importar lo que la gente hable.

Fire In My Eyes 
At this point I've lost control
Falling farther in my hole
It will take, more than, you know
Till this day I'm walking tall
Just cause I know I've lost it all
I am fading away
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
Still I don't, know what it's for
Cannot take too many more
Of these pills, they make, me sick
Forever I'll be the same
There is no one else to blame
But myself, 
I am the only one
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
And I know I'll find peace today
The fire in my eyes
Will I ever get to say
Go Away
I watch myself
I'm living a lie
I seem to falter
Even though that I try so hard
So with this kiss I walk away
It will be gone today, today
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
And I know I'll find peace today
The fire in your eyes
Will I ever get to say
Go Away
I watch myself
I'm living a lie
I seem to falter
Even though that I try so hard
So with this kiss I walk away
It will be gone today, today

Heavy Hearts 
What is in front of you
Yet you still turn away
I call out your name
Everytime you lie
Your fading faster
We want to help you
But you must ask us first
So, please believe, forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like this
If only, you could see
Falling farther inside
And you've forgotten now
Everything you were before
And do you really even try
To stop yourself from
The death of you
You are wasting away, So
Please believe(please belive), forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like this
If only, you could see
Look inside the mirror friend and tell me what you find
If you don't see the ugliness than you are blind
Cause you've fallen too far, you won't wake up! 
Shaking, unmoving I hate you for this
Leavin behind, all of us
Selfish, and fucked up you've ruined everything
You have only one chance, So
Please believe(please belive), forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like that
If only, you could see
All we done(All we done), it's for you
Although, you are gone
Cause you wasted(you wasted), so much
Of everthing
For you, we cry tonight

Who's the next radical
Keep me fed up with the same old get up
What's enough for me is enough for you
And you're leaving town to get a new tattoo
Make it mega bright for you
Future is bright for you
I meant to get away
Dent in history
Religion
To heal the incision
Loud and clear
Your actions speak so loud and clear
Yesterday so fresh and new
You can't decide what is fresh and new
'Cause sarcasm has got the best of me
When the future looks bright for you
See my image on the TV screen
It's actions speak so loud and clear
It'll give you what you want
But what you want is drilled inside your head
Don't listen to me I'm just a hypocrite
A victim of this simple circumstance

lies beneath my toes

that deep in mexico
there's a voice
that's all her own
stolen goods to find
from deep inside my mind invited
breeding ground of shame

Mr. Whipple 
Here's a little story about Mr. Whipple
Thinking about how he'd like to buy a motorcycle
Trying to run down all those fickle people
People squeezing Charmin
Don't be afraid of Mr. Whipple
Then he came across a very fine lady
Goes up to her and says "Hey Hey Hey Baby
Let's go down to the deli
Where I can rub that big old Whipple belly!"
He's got the paper that surely won't grind
When you go to the store he's the one you'll find
When you leave the store he's the one you'll miss
You'll want to give Whipple a big old

I know things deep inside of me 
The excitement that I swallow 
I swallow things that I can't see 
I know you're right behind me 
But I'm too dumb to turn around

Am I the stupidest boy in town

Can you see my mouth open wide 
Lopsided and confused 
The dead weight of my left arm 
And already sold that you will refuse 
Substance dream mechanical failure 
My little lost boy trying to sound

Am I the stupidest boy in town 
Pain is good if I had understood 
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide 
Numbness disappears when you are near 
Nicky, take me for a ride 
Your daddy is smiling at me 
White horses flowing through his veins 
Impossible eyes, forgotten future 
And enough angst-ridden guilt to go insane 
A walk together, a walk that hurt 
A road I didn't know and soon forgot 
I wake with my left arm numb 
He's not with you, will you be with me

Stuck with weight that's hard to hide

sea of tranquility
i've thrown away the key
your secret's safe with me

Hunt Of The Unnamed 
This desert landscape continues forever
Mountains in the distant land
I've continued on this quest for only god knows how long
Hate and love the reasons i go on
Hate for the monsters that did this to me
Love for my family they took away
My only friend teela marches along
Toward their ever-nearing death
On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole
I only count the day by the grains of sand i see
The night by my chilling memories.
My only hope is that one day this quest will cease
And the pain will leave my body free
That dark night often plays out to me
I hear the screams of my dear family.
The last look that my wife gave to me
So much pain, for this they will pay.
On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole

3 Leaf Loser 
Biting the hand that feeds you, lying to the voice
Inside, reach out to beg for something this life
Is a lesson, take what you're given feeding on
Self destruction, waiting to explode again, no
Sign of resolution this life is a lesson, take what
You're given
You don't need direction to find your way, don't
You listen to yourself now and again killing
Time, killing you mind over matter, stop and 
Listen to yourself now
Bend me before i breakdown, dying to be free
Within, it's not how you'd like to see it this life 
Is a lesson, take what you're given forcing your
Self solution as you fall into line again, when
Will i find the answers this life is a lesson, take
What you're given
Falling to the ground, left face down as i recall
The mirrors ugly glare

You say you know just who I am
But you can't imagine
What waits for you across the line
You thought you had me
But I'm still here standing
And I'm tired of backing down
And I'm here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
Been to hell and back again
I won't take this
You try so hard to bring me down
You can't break the broken
You still don't seem to understand
It's your turn to see just
How it feels to be me
How it feels to be knocked down
And you're here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
You've been to hell and back again
You can't take this
Remember
This feeling
How it feels to be alive
Now you see me through my eyes
And we're here now feeling the beat
Of a thousand hearts
Coming back to life again
We can make it
Remember

Arms Of A Stranger

Couldn't wait to hold you
I've been away for so long
But as I walked through the doorway
My heart was shattered
To find that your not alone
When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger
The days just seem so much longer
Now that I'm without you
It never seems to get better
I'll try to hold it together
And I can't wait for
The day that you fade from my memory
When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger
When will I break

Bitter 
Mother mother can you hear me, i keep trying
Just to find me all i know now, all you s how me,
Endless questions, hopeless ending
This bitter pill is pushing me away and now i feel
Like there's nothing left to say and i pretend to 
Look the other way but in the end will i be okay,
Will i be okay
Father father will you be there as i cry out
Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,
Numb to this dream sleeing within
Before i face another day, won't you let asleep,
Lost among the dreams that always comfort me
And before i find my feet, won't you show me
What i need, what i need to walk again

Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that you will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in you
Cause I'm broken 
I know I need you now
Cause deep inside I'm broken 
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
I question why you chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall
And all in all faith is blind
But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take your life
All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from you again
All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothing's gonna change
Until I'm broken

Time, moves slowly while you're gone
I haven't heard your voice in quite some time
But I still see your face
I cannot erase the things you've done
And all the ways you kept me hangin' on
Now your gone
I've moved on
And I don't feel so sorry
Can't you see I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed anymore
I've held on
For so long
But I had to let you go
At the end of our broken road
I know, it hurts to hear the truth
Well maybe
I was never meant to be with you
And I cannot replace
The tears of disgrace
That run for you
Cause running from the truth is what you do
Now your gone
I've moved on
And I don't feel so sorry
Can't you see I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed anymore

Crash 
As I lie tossing in my bed
Lost in my fears remembering what you said
And I try to hide the truth within
The mask of myself shows its face again
Still I lie time and time again
Will you deny me when we meet again?
And I feel like I'm falling
Farther every day
But I know that you're there
Watching over me
And I feel like I'm drowning
The waves crashing over me
But I know that your love
It will set me free
As I find truth where I found it times before
As I search for your hope
I'm finding so much more
And I try to be more like you
And I deny myself to prove my heart is true
I hear your voice calling
The time has come for me
Inside this life I'm living
There's nothing left for me
My mind is slowly fading
So far away from me
Each time I start crawling
You're there watching me

Far Away 
Something keeps on pulling me down
And I feel like I'm losing ground
Trying just to find my reasons
And losing sense of what is real
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time
[Chorus:]
Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you every day
Waiting just to see the image
You follow down my road again
Trying just to find your purpose
You're fading faster every day
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time
[Chorus]
Now I feel I'm losing time
Yesterday slipped away
When you didn't know
Time and time again you wanted more than I had to give
To leave me with nothing
I'm waiting and dreaming
Yesterday slipped away
When you didn't know
And no more waiting
Let me back

(Now I'm feeling)
So far away

And I'm so scared of all the ways
You take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play
I don't know why
And I don't know how
I let you control my inner self
As cold as you are
I'm counting the scars
They're proving to me just who you are
Now I know why now I know how
I'm better off without the
Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways you take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play

Hey Love 
Looking back on everything I've done
I never thought I'd find the one
To share the dreams that only I had seen
Locked in the deepest part of me
I took a chance to lay it on the line
There was nothing left to hide behind
If you never love then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Now I'm screaming
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
Thinkin back on everything we've done
We watched the waves drown the sun
We shared a dream that both us had seen
And we made it our reality
We found a way to stand the test of time
All of our doubts were left behind
If you never love, then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Well I'm screamin'
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
If darkness should fall upon our hearts
Remember the dreams from the start
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
I can't breathe when you're not here

Home 
In my eyes you see the pain
With each lie I take the blame
With each sigh I slowly fall away
You are there when I need you
You sew me up when I bleed through
The endless cloth of lies surrounding me
Everything that I am you have given me
The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
I hide in darkness blind to sense
Chasing a dream with false pretense
Help me find the fracture in this dark sky
Everything that I believe is slowly overtaking me
I'm just trying to find my way back home
Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home
You can't bring me down 
Cause I'm going home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home

In Closing 
Step back inside the lie again, you'll find you're 
Wearing thin
Killing the sympathy as you take another swing 
At me now
Fighting your inner self again, losing what
You feel
Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real
Now
It's over and i don't feel a thing but you're
Trying to break the scar again your spirit is
Bleeding as you grin but your bridge keeps on
Burning at both ends
In your mind, the ending seems to be so far from
What you need
Take back the memories as you smile to hide the
Pain from me now
Shut down the curiosity that brings you here
Again
No sense of purity as you try to take the life
From me now
Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly
Erase
All the hateful things you did and now i'm
Through with you nothing you could ever say
Nothing you could ever say
Hope you're happy now

In My Head 
I'm reaching out without a sound
My pride falls to the floor again
Inside my mind I search to find
A place just to call my own
Deep inside your eyes 
I am blinded by your love
Still I run so far just to find that
I'm alone again
In my head
I hear you calling me
And I can't run cause there's nothing left for me
When I fall you always follow me deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside of my head
I just can't last as these feelings pass
Once again I hide the pain inside
The smile wears thin and the lies begin
To bring me down again
When I run I run so far away from you
I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again
And all my faith I put in you
This time you take it all away 
Inside my head
Deep inside 
My head

It Was You 
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
I was sick of all the pain
Tired of all the shame that I felt
But you showed me a way
To never have a doubt
And always to believe in myself
Now I see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you
I'm so sorry 'bout the ways
ut I can't take away my past
But you love me anyway
And now I wanna do
Everything for you that I can
Even though it won't erase
The foolish things that I've done
Things that blinded me
But now I see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
So how can I make this up to you
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive
Can't you see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you
I can see the writing on the wall
As time begins to crawl away from me
And I've become what I am
Because of you
It was you

Lie To Me 
Our candle burns away
The ashes full of lies
I gave my soul to you
You cut me from behind
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
Cuz who I am, is where you wanna be
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end...
You said you were there for me
You wouldn't let me fall
All the times I shared with you
Were you even there at all?
Nowhere to run and no where to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
Cuz who I am, is where you wanna be
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end
Why'd you have to up and run away
A million miles away
I wanna close my eyes and make believe
That I never found you
Just when I put my guard away
It's the same old story
You left me broken and betrayed
It's the same old story
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end...
Lie to me once again
It's the same old story
Lie to me once again
It's the same old story
Was it worth it in the end...

Desperate and waiting, frozen to the core, numb
To this feeling, needing something more all  i 
Keep thinking is where i need to be, all i can hope
For is someone to take me away
Before you go you promise me something, i need
To know will you leave me lifeless leaving me
Lifeless
Will i bow down to this life that i live, will i find
Freedom or lose it all again all i keep thinking is
Where i need to be, all i can hope for is someone
To take me away
Before you go you promise me something, i need

Something again

Open Your Eyes 
When I look into your eyes 
I see a lot of hate
Pushing me away
You're haunted by a past
A past that brings you down
So you throw it all away
Again
Just try to find a place deep within your soul
And don't deny the child living deep inside
Open your eyes and find 
This life's better than you know
It's in your hands now
Just open up your eyes
Deep inside of your mind
You're forced to believe
That nothing's gonna change
So I take you by the hand
And I lead you to a place
A place of happiness

Believe
You fall deep inside again nothing left to see
Weakness fills your heart again you put it to
Rest
Forfeit everything because you were never
Strong enough
Close my eyes again and pray that life will not
Give up
I try to see your face again a photograph for me
Your voice calling out again nothing left for me
You try to find your place again waiting just to
Breathe
Weakness takes your heart again you put it to
Rest....locked inside again
Did you forget about the things i said 
Fight the lies inside your head
Deny those who try to bring you down
Kill the pain and emptiness
Find a love and lose yourself
Without this life you're just a memory...locked

Running Out Of Pain 
As he raises his hand you begin to understand
That no love is worth the hate that you feel
Now you're running out of pain
And all these feelings feel the same
So you close your eyes and wish it all away
And I lie awake and I try to say
Anything I know just to ease your pain
But you hide away where no one can see
And it's only you that can set you free
Now the time has come again
So you reach deep down within 
To find the strength that you have buried there
As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say 
You'll never make it in this world alone
You try to fight (you try to fight)
You hide the pain (you hide the pain)
You walk away (never again)

Every morning as I wake to another day
I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray
I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find
Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind
You always take me to a higher level
Show something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew
You push me you pull me
You set my soul on fire
You take me so much higher
Higher again
Thank you for it all
Everyday living this life not knowing what it means
Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams
And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see
All their troubles and their pain staring back at me
You always take me to a higher level
You show me something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew
You push me you pull me
You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see
You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see

I'm sorry for needing you to carry me
So simple sometimes when you're standing next
To me
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing
Take it all away from me and tell me how you
Want this to be
I want you i need you
A life without you made me wonder why i'm here
Until i found nothing ever seemed so clear
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing
I lose myself in everything you say i lose myself
In everything
I never knew that i could feel this way i never
Knew that i could feel

The Way I Feel 
Lately I've been wandering
Off the narrow path
You've given me so many things that I've never had
And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through
If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true
Cause I hate the way I feel tonight
And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice 
The world I know is pulling me
More and more each day
I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray
Spiteful eyes are watching me
With everything I do
In the midst of darkness Lord
My spirit calls for you
(You know sometimes deep inside)
I feel like this

This Dark Day 
I'm flushing the pills
I've lost all my will
This has been haunting me way to long
And I can't rewind
I'm the suffering kind
I've been abusing way to long
I'm breaking
Suffocating
I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done
Now I'm trapped in the wake
Of all my mistakes
I've been under for way to long
I sit and I shake
My heart starts to race
The poison lingers in my veins
I'm fading
Suffocating
I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done
You said I'd never change
You said I'd never had the strength
To break away
But now I've changed
It's time to turn the page
And walk away
It's time to walk away, it's time to away...
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done
Now that this dark day is done

Waiting For Yesterday 
It's a long way back to reality, she puts another
Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago
Trying to figure out where things went wrong
Searching through all the lies she told
Somehow she missed out on all the things that
She needed most days spent wondering why this
Life is so cold and nothing ever changes
Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal
Yesterday
Hiding all emotion far away
Trying to find his self confidence, another 
Broken heart behind the painless smile that he
Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone
And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he
Missed out on all the things he needed most days
Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and
Nothing ever changes
Tomorrow's still a miracle

World So Cold 
It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions
No one can answer
A stain
Covers your heart
Tears you apart just like a sleeping cancer
Now I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe this world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world to we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feelings
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
Are you sane? Where's the shame
A moment of time passes by
You cannot rewind
Who's blame and where did it start
Is there a cure for your sickness, have you no heart?
Now I don't believe men are born killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees
Never, never, never, never, never do this again
It starts with pain followed by hate
Now I don't believe men are born to be killers
And I don't believe this world can't be saved
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feelings
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
In a world so cold

Break Up Letter 
If I told you one day,
That I would never hurt you.
That I would be a promise I can't make
If I told you someday, 
That this could be true love forever.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
If I made you cry 1000 times
would you still take me back
and I miss you
and I swore to God I would never miss you
if I told you I'm ok
and all my friends are doing great without you here
this letters so impersonal she said
the words just seem to pour right off the page
this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make
If I left you here for six long years
your washed up you feel used
are you jaded
and I pray to God you don't hate me
if I say I'll be home soon
a broken heart and an empty room is all you'll find
with a letter in the middle of the floor
the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somehow I can't breathe
this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make
So tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
cause I can't read your mind
so tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
it's hard to see things clear
behind your blackened eyes
and I could make things right
if all the stars aligned
a different place a different time
cross my heart and hope you die
the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somewhere I can't breathe
I know I made my share of mistakes
but you were the worst one
the worst mistake I ever made

Night To Remember 
This could be a night to remember, but you still give me nightmares I'll never forget. Im sleeping with the lights on tonight so before you go, Ill tell you what Im thinking. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending now. Im anticipating, all these phone calls youre desperately making. Im dying from the sound of your voice. Before you go, try to stop the bleeding. Ill leave the lights on so you can find your way back home. When you get here all of these doors they will be locked closed. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. Do you really want a one night romance. Do you really want a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. You always ask me where we went wrong. It must have been the day that I wrote this song. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Life is full of regrets put on your shoulders. Theres a whisper in your left ear loud and clear. A casual conversation. Let me know, are you dialing the phone. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. Do you really want a one night romance. Do you really want a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. I need you like a hole in the head. Im thinking that Im better off dead than spending one more night with you

Perfect Love Song 
Turn those headlights off and lets not make a sound. Whisper in my ear how much you want me around. If you wanted to tell me how much you would miss me when Im gone. Now would be the time. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt. You say its all my fault that you spend your nights alone, cause every time you called me I was never home. Well maybe Im with your best friend laughing at your imperfections or the stupid things youve said. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt. If you wanted to kill me slowly, tell me youll be mine forever. If you wanted to kill me slowly, we could spend our lives together. Ive been waiting, just kill yourself so I can move on. No more wasting time. Ill cut your throat so you wont sing along. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt

If I had known all these roads had led to you
I would of crashed this car
now I'm leaving you with all this sorrow
and send me your very best

you said that you would die for me
I know it's hard but try the best you can
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night
you said you lie awake
and cry yourself to sleep
while lying in my bed
so I'm asking one question and I'll try to make it brief
do you care if I'm alive or you're dead
you said you would die for me
just wait a while I'm sure you'll get your chance
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night
the wait is over,
say good bye to what you had
and I'll miss you
it's all those quiet things that no one talks about
it's over, it's over
it's so over
always and forever, I'll miss you more than ever
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright

All I really want is to lay gently down beside you
That's the part I miss the most of all 
After she left me
And maybe it's not fair to touch your hair 
&
 think about her
But I know no other way to ease the pain 
&
 heartache
Forget about it...
Hey you wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
I need to understand 
Am I in your future plans 
Or just a one-night stand 
Come on and let me know   
You wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
Done everything I can 
To be your superman 
Yeah I'm your biggest fan 
Come on and let me know 
You wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
Done everything I can 
To be your superman 
Yeah I'm your biggest fan

This Is It 
Eddies got a walking stick
But he doesn't move, to fast
Every time he goes outside
He's taking a ride, with me
And Johnnys got a rocking chair
And all of his hair, I swear
And reading is his favourite way 
To spend his time, all day

Hey
This is it
This is it
This is it
Betty was a movie star 
And I'm on gaurd, tight flicks
And when she tells you all about
You better watch out, that's it
Loretta wet her bed last night
But that's alright, I said
She kissed me as I pulled the shade
But then I waved, goodnight.

Hey
This is it
This is it
This is it
Nonnie fell and broke her hip
It's harder to skip, these days
The sleeping occupies your time
After the wine, settles in
Margies in a produce pile 
Shes been there awhile, all night
She's digging for the perfect plum
With a bottle of rum, that's right
(x4)
Hey
This is it

The ether was wearing off. The acid was long gone. But the mescaline was running strong. Good mescaline comes on slow. First hour's all waiting, and then about halfway through second hour. You start cursing the creep who burned you because nothing's happening. And then...
Come on now, let's all take some mescaline!

Karma 
* [Prolouge]
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They gonna slap you back (yer)
Sometimes it hurts
And thats bad karma
Watch out for it
[Chorus]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed
Well I guess I'll have to live day to day
and pray to god that'll I'll be ok, ay ay
[Verse 1]
These fat raps think they fit like they The Iron Man
I got the iron tounge and the iron hand
I make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet so switch the picture
If ya, look in the mirror you bound to get a reflection
Like with, every action there is a reaction
with your, dodgy actions you causing negative drama
And if you know gods law you best watch for karma
Now I'm a bomb ya
Running your traps like tacks
You think you floating on the cream
You and your rat pack
While I'm take that thought back now lets dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and (you's a matador)
I'm seeing red
(You outta swords)
I'm a target like
(Dartsboards)
You floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first while ya shakin I cut off like
umbilicals at birth
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I look around the city and its all such a pity
everybody trying to be pretty don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block nobodys playing hopscotch
there to busy on the internet surfing that rap
[Verse 3]
Just converse kind of rude like
(so what you trying to prove mate)
I say, (nothing I'm just trying to build the feeling I live like you)
I got plans to take this city up to senate
As lifes one big race and want all entrys to win it
If your not with it, like quitters then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
Your a disgrace with a desire
You need to recon through your fire and look higher higher! look around!
I got sounds that help you get down so you can get up
But oh boy i'm sick of raps that get me fed up
Yer they make me wanna throw up cause they gotta grow up
But well I'll be feeling a beard and I'll be Sailing like NOAH
[Chorus]
[Interlude 1]
Melbourne.....To Sydney......To Brisbane...Darwin.... To
Perth.....Adelaide.... Tassy
And all Across the OZ..Z..I..E...
[Verse 4]
Picture on the quota its time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall so
I got a key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And when I unlock the door I'm bringing love to my people
unlike these Fickle Fanatics that wanna cause death
cut holes flake praying we fall to hells depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
as what goes up comes down never the less
We're stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
boomerang effect as we all face our karma
[Chorus]

Bathing In Hate 
I used to care until you showed me how weak I was
I used to care until my eyes filled with hate
I used to think I had the one thing that never died
I found the truth to late
Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me
I used to be so much more than this
I used to be the one with open arms
I used to know who I could trust
Dreams to dust
Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me

Replay Today 
The face I wear today
Will soon fade away
And the dreams I have made
Will die where they lay
Call it cowardice for not seeing it til the end
Show you these open wounds I've got to start to mend
Trust is not my friend
As faith walks out again
Unwilling to bend
The strength I need ascend
Let my weakness carry me I cannot fight alone
Show me every single fault and turn my heart to stone
Replay today
I never wanted to be blind
Replay today
I didn't want to be this kind

State Of Mind 
Look into my eyes and you will see
The way your thoughts should be
Listen to the tone of my voice
And understand you have no choice
This is the way it will be
All your days with me
I don't understand what you hope to gain
You always know it ends in pain
Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time
I've said the same thing since the very start
That we will never be apart
I've held your hand and I have held it tight
Even when it trembled in fright
No one knows the truth like I do
That everything is caused by you
You bring it on yourself so dry those tears
No one hears
Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time
It's you and me until the end
You and me until the end
You and me until the end
It's you and me until the end
Your state of mind
Will fall in line

Strength 
Don't see what you do
And I haven't for so long
Where is this wealth of inner resolve
This foundation you think I stand upon
Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength
Jackhammer pounds the mind
You're nothing without me
Hearing these words echo through my head
This twisted, distorted image stands instead
Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength
I can't see
What you see in me
So how can I believe
That what you see
Is me

The Lesson 
I heard every word you've said
Even if my eyes were closed
I felt every statement you made
Even when you chose not to speak
Look at what I have become
This pathetic shell youve constructed
I am your living legacy
Broken, battered, bruised, by your love
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end
Why can't you look me in the eyes
Does it frighten you to see yourself
I can see how that would cause you pain
I've felt it everyday myself
All at once it seems so clear
I don't have to be trapped here
I can pick up my pieces and walk away
From this shattered life you've led for me
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end
You're nothing without me
I'm nothing with you
I am who you are
I'm better than that
You have no place to go
Anywhere but here
Who else would hold your hand
Then let me go
Take my pride
Take my faith
Take my trust
Take my dignity
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end

i see the tables turning
they turn with speed
i watch the fire burning
burning to the sea
i heard a holy story
i laughed out loud
a man who chases the wind
never should be proud
they can always find a way
to pull you down
make you feel so small invisible
another sent to take the final part of me
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
when i am barely breathing
they come for me
i wish i never saw them
walk all over me
they can always find a way to pull you down
make you feel so small invisible
another sent to take the final part of me
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
it's my fault
i should have never trusted
it never fails
to bring me down
so hear me out
always busted
you got yours
guess i got mine
your high score
my waste of time
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray

Erase 'em All 
Building the walls around it
Created self with nothing much
Without a cost to find it
Feeling avoid and losing touch
The borrowed taste his novelty
Could be a product of another's humility
Don't worry your loss wil be his gain
He wouldn't hesitate to turn his back on you
And it might be true
Erase 'em all - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall befoer you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all
The warning's out it's gonna come to an end and I
Hate to see him label me as a friend tonight
Never question my intentions without the right
Showing me another way to turn his back on you
And it might be you
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
You wanna stay you'd better run
When I catch up you better have a gun
I'm so wound up from playin' dumb
This time it's real and real isn't fun
You never saw this side before
Don't test the water for what's in store
I drew the line and I learned a rule
What's good for me isn't good for you
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy

Jimmy 
Jimmy
It started out with a few misfortunes
His daddy ran off with some broad from the motown
When momma said we're leavin tomorrow
Jimmy already had his things together
So many days of thinking of the past
The girl he left behind and hangin out in the
free streets
Somehow Jimmy had survived his reflections
The broken glass in his hands, a noose before him
Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix and a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face
Jimmy's the leader of a losin' race
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always know what you were missin'
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction
Some people say it was fright that drove him
But Jimmy knows who's really scared of difference
The whipping boy won't take his beating
It only left them alone to their thinking
Of how he knew what they could never know
And he would live and learn to be himself
through his mistakes
Watch and laugh, pretend they were okay
Waiting for things to change is just another day
Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix or a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face
Jimmy's the leader of a losing race
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always knew what you were missin'
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction
Hey Jimmy don't you walk away
We'll look at life according to me
You're my life support auto biography
Hey Jimmy take a look inside
Let's take a chance, enjoy the ride
Impressions don't die
No one knew your story
Hey Jimmy did you learn you lesson
You always knew what you were missin' (Jimmy)
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction (Jimmy)
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always knew what you were missin' (Jimmy)

Every face sing we had to happen, every
face is you
Every smile that I force on someone sends me
to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
Troubles times that I find myself in, double
without you
Such a lose that I try to replace sends me
to the edge
Living breaks I take because, I need more
time to get a buzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
All the times that we tried to make it
Now those days are through
All the times we were forced to fake it send
me to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
Spending hours trting to find myself-
Redemption, wrong direction
No more power to control my - Isolation no solution
Every voice that I know is not the same
Every word taht I read calls out your name
So many days looking for you but in vein
A losin' game and I'm to blame
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't
afford to face the facts
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't

Lightshow 
Wish I could stay but I gotta run
I got some miles to go and no destination
And like you've never seen, my light is always green
The ice is melting and the bitch ain't helping
I sink the eight-ball from the cue, before you
know I'm through
With blurred validity I can see you in me
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the same wine that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadow, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
Spit you out
My thoughts aren't set in stone and I'm committed
to go where few have
ever roames, and through the klgiht show I witness
the unknown
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the smae wint that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadows, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
I've been drinking to my health
Gotta get off me, get away from me
I've been sinking to my hell
Gotta get off me, get away from me,
I've been living for myself

Outside Looking In 
Somebody told him that their way was the right way
He never took a chance, her never had a
chance
Cause he was force fed he had to live his
death sentence
See, he was a new face with a nice smile
He got sucked in got spit out
He was the winner by the standars of gold-digger
A success story in six figures
Outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
Outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn your back to the world
So then he grew old, he thought he grew wise
He thought he'd know a bad seed in swarm of flies
They couldn't wait to consider him family
Take what they could get and keep walkin'
And on his death bed surrounded by his friends
He saw the faces and no substance, let go
With a smile of serenity, he needed change for enternity
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on a dream
On the outside looking in
He should of seen their dream as a sin
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
On the outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn you back on the world
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him

Pick Your Poison 
Running from yourself like you're stranded
And now you're exactly where
You never thought you would be
In the dark without a light to guide you
What once was a breath
Is now a gasp to survive
You left so much behind
So many questions unanswered
The other side
The crash to the burn
The fingers that picket
For your solid satisfaction
Belong to the hands
Wrapped around your neck so tight
[Chorus]
You live today, Without a care
Tomorrow will come and I'll still be here
I gave myself to you and you left me with lies
And there will come a time when you have so much
But there's so little that you can touch
And still I consider you a friend
For every temporary sucker
That's in place
That you need
Is another cry
For you to return
You've been there
You've been square
But nothing in between
Now it's time to find those
Who are looking for you tonight
[Chorus]
It's hard to accept
But there's people that don't care
In a world so cold
And they seem unfair
But you've got to realise
You have a purpose
And it's not through your nose
That you can see the light
When I was scared
You picked me up
You told me never to forget
That I'll be there by your side
So here I am
We've gone too far
And it's been a long time
Since we've been at peace
We followed a part
But I still know
That behind the mask
Is a familiar face
It's you

You watch and know
Unspoken not forgotten
As one we've grown
And sometimes soft,
So soft could penetrate a rock
You know we
Got to make it

Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still know me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
And what's in store
Get into character for
Allegiance sworn
A sufface aquisition
Maybe an allusion, together still
Our selfish route together
Not taken by another
No shoes to fill
The steps that we're taken are not to be mistaken and
yah there's fear
but waken to get up to find maybe it's better
to spin the gear
Got to make it, see to it, straight through it
Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still hate me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
The word on the street is strong, speaks for
itself, belongs to no one else
(WIll you still know me when I'm gone)
And I'm calling on all of you, we've paid our dues

Scared Away 
Somebody once said
Stop when the light turns red
I know the story
But I don't want the glory
Cause when you're shot down
You're gonna hit ground
But they don't feel it
No they won't heal it
I've given everything
I've played the name game
I sent my get well cards
And never got an answer
Don't want my money back
These cards are not stacked
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shaking under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
Can I get close enough
So you can hold me up
And tell me over and over
I went bad again
I'll tell you one thing
Without a promise ring
That I don't need it
I won't believe it
When it's down to this
I get oblivious
I see you looking
But you don't wanna see a thing
Being so scared
Can't get you anywhere
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
See what's wrong see what's wrong
See what's wrong with me, what's wrong with me
Me looking at you, you looking away
And I'm wondering how the one I know had changed
Me reaching to touch someone
But you're gone, tired now
Scared away somehow
Scared away somehow
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more

And you're drowned in illusions
And you're covered in your shelters

Still you don't work enough to make it yours.
You're tired of this routine
But you don't make a change
You're afraid to make things worse
An now that your life is gone
And you've missed the starting gun
You begin to think about this chance you've lost
Now that the sun is gone
And you can't find it no matter how you try
You begin to believe that your life is done

Irish Song 
Wake up in the morning and have a couple beers
I guess it's how we hide our hurt, that's better than tears
We have our nights of getting rowdy and getting fucking drunk
Going to the bar and putting dead guys in the trunk
Everyone's got an Irish song and now so do we
We just couldn't help it, it was our destiny
Lucky Charms and Guinness, sure sounds good to me
Everyone has an Irish song so why shouldn't we?
Some people tell me Tom, you drink to fucking much
Everytime that you guys play you use liquor as a crutch
Well I say, fuck you!
Don't you worry about me
Gin, whiskey, jagre, beer is how I keep my sanity
Lucky Charms and Guinness sure sounds good to me
Everyone's got an Irish song so now so do we
I'll beat you with my shillelagh
Your neck belongs to me
Everyone's got an Irish song so now so do we

Morning's here again, but I'll just stay in bed
I think I'd rather sleep the day away
Things have been worse before
I guess I can't complain
Just another day of doing what I love to hate
Time is a cruel thing, it never waits for me
The more I think about it, the more my life is pissed away
Cause I've spent most my time, looking for some answers
I should just shut my mouth and take my fucking chances
It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
And Danny is crying again
Life is a moment, I can't forget today
Waste it all, wishing it was yesterday
Cause when I sing these songs, everything's okay
Jack up that stereo, we'll make it through another day
It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you

Ghostwork 
hour hero yes, had showed you there'd be days like this...
and you find yourself longing for a certain drastic context
a dreadful circumstance that will tack great lengths onto
your dictionary definition
to soothe your leaden understanding of bread, water, and money
now arriving by an alternate route at where the absence
of such things might leave you
mind you, this is not more rich confession of a child actor
and as you would agree completely with a gift cyst as it appeared in your throat
the decision to further limit the pain registrar
and delight your tiny heart a moment with uncontested omnipresence will...
you've had the wind knocked out of you by something life size
and you're afraid to say to your face
you stretch the pen and cheat the sleep
this sort of evening you want to say something your words cannot
note: which leaves your ghost blowing up globes
tying them off with an x axis c-clamp
and setting them down
for 7 days and 7 nights
you've sewn a cloth copy of your nervous system
to a turtle neck and pair tuxedo pants
outside the city's dry all covered in primer
you have lost control of your hair
yesterday you were shot for a magazine cover
fatigue swapped your body build with all urge and by the door
you heard demo's creaking squeezing a squeal from your guilt
against the clinging teeth of their cd-tray
all beneath the inner half of the door knob
hissing at its other head
hung in the sun
you're staring at a quill as the lump sum of its parts
and it's begun to look brutal
4 walls of day: and that alone
no empty hallway for you bearing the
100 bright light blocking doors of luck
and here in the favor of life i will
contrive no device against expectation, only announce
i have learned to respect the color yellow
for one reason or another.
and in the insurmountable non strength of one's weight

Your ghost blowing up globes 
tightening them off with an X-axis esque c-clamp
Then setting them down through the clouds 
onto empty department store shelves.
Where they sit faving all sorts of islands
out toward bead wee-hour isles
has the earth come loose from its galactic neck beneath
you. Let go from the space surround it
cut off above the clouds
dropped down done to the sun syestem's floor
crooked pearl of the one universe
cleaved, tell rolling toward a corner of the cosmos
in the blacked and quiet of some time
"and you are all lamb, for this."
Spring is at your back again
this time rare with your calrity. . .
while patches of you thought whole
had turned up still.
made a tar of your woe
and flesh where in
Have you gone half dead. . . 
yet. . .yet have you to let the worst most be
as if it were atlas to your world of cope.
And no one is out there scared you'd set your eyes off on the ceiling

you on the ledge of all 241 ways to be you...basing guess upon guess
there...where...somewhere between motivated and cold
believing your good friends down to the bile in their beautymarks...
they who found you counting back toward yourself
so haven't dreamt and heavily armed
yet another blues thief told in however and oneday...
and every monday things begin with indiscriminate street noise
more vague and normal alliance of all those with high levels of work
in their blood and clock in their wake
up early shaving damp breakfast skulls with fresh lady's leg razor
so that the oneday the moon might hold a half million nice size
hoods easy
and plenty fast restaurants
by cum and by egg
and laid low into creature
then
cast out in the one cold of all names,
this song is about disabowed sperm
and the mining of human concern
many cells split, many men died in 1998
the year of my strong, fair rap collection
there are foot prints embraced far out on the frozen lake face
depressed and kept from quite some cold ago,
and they look brave, dangerous, man made
the sort of mark one can make on the world
you borrowed the camera from why
and set it up over by the printer and horsehead
obsessed with your pressing record
to indulge in the shadows of both here and immortal
is it god to name things from thin air
to have the wind blow a few hundred dollar bills into your wallet
to have 100 cc's liquid luck supplement
dug into your blood
by needle point and distant star
are you busy losing yourself
in the quiet cell of abandoned old oakland
pants undone, stole eye starting to water
nailing a sign that speaks fear to a bank at the man made lake
you cop you
will you now resort to black umbrellas in the sight blanching sun
or stay indoors taking the pill to your face...
striking that lightning on nothing
attempting to teach yourself the art of cloning at home
in a smock killing single cell sheep for straight weeks
'til you give it all up for photoshop and using your teeth
there in a box with your things, stabbed airholes, and one wing
or white lung, when your well will you stay
since there is a certain modern earth pain only fit for enduring
which one does endure
like returning a foster child twice or
going the distance on songs for somebody else's compilation.
no one's out there scared you'd set your eyes off
all night on the ceiling in the dark
think of a song or maybe breasts
i thought i told you, this is not new...
skinned by the speed of my one life
you have the desperate fair to your eyes
the look of a child who has just swallowed a coin or army man
almost too attuned to the spoils of loved
wishing he'd been born some sort of succulent or larvae
but you're too soft for all that
you like your blood kept in the movies
and your head in a jar or a vase in a van on tour
your guts clumped like dung in a sturdy hatbox
heart slung safely in the stomach of a clean sock or two
here you are a bag of milk to do tricks
and not as a function of pennies
and how you've dreamt
nosdam's skull been predatored

Ti mentirei spudoratamente dicendoti che non ne vorrei almeno a fiumi. 
E se tu mi reputi intelligente sai che tra questa gente oramai 
sei considerato un nullafacente se non hai almeno un conto 
in banca con tanti contanti. 
"E' un mondo difficile. Felicit? a momenti e vita incerta" io vigile su quello che ho, 
perch? ogni giorno 
? incredibile il numero di uomini che farebbero di tutto per fottere me o il prossimo. 
Non resta che diventare pi? rabbini degli altri, pi? scaltri, 
rubare perfino le caramelle ai bambini. 
Dici che sono cinico ma il caso ? clinico, credimi, 
Non basta applicarsi al minimo per restare in bilico, vedimi. 
Questo ? tutto quello che posso dirti lo so, 
ma la fuori non ? rose e fiori ? il manicomio. 
Per questi dannati soldi elicotteri in cielo e carrarmati in terra.

Demoni 
Strofa 1 (Domasan):
Esseri umani mettono anime in vendita
Almeno cos? ? di norma/ siedi e guarda/ c'? da assistere con calma
Potrei immaginarmi che vengano a cercarmi, per leggere il mio karma
Usarlo come arma per minacciarmi
Paranoie per noi/ nate per noia/ per spaventarmi
E poi la pioggia ed il vento/ il fuoco e gli stenti
Il gioco di giudizi, interventi
Preferenze e privilegi che ostenti
Vite intere/ sofferenti alla ricerca del migliore offerente
Il respiro sar? la mia armatura/ resto indifferente
Vedo demoni ed angeli leggere vangeli
Promettere che si va in cielo
Quando l'assenza di sole sulla terra porter? il gelo/ non permettere
Altrimenti ti danno anatemi
Che stendono al suolo e provocano danni
fonemi/ pesanti come atemi
la fuori ? desolazione
attimi in cui si ? costretti a firmare contratti
atti con i quali illuminarmi/ come astri
distratti da illusioni/ catastrofi
ascolto suoni/ stabilisco tempi
uso contrasti per continuare a scrivere testi
sfidando i miei disastri quando prendono forma
metamorfosi di frasi e storie in strofe
non rimane che rimuovere scorie/ fare brillare diamanti
vibrare corpi come navi nella tempesta/ scosse da correnti
ci hanno convinti a stare bene con pasticche di estasi
tenuti seduti con pasti caldi
conditi con sedativi a grandi dosi per curare nervi tesi
crisi d'astinenza crea astio/ bisogna uscirne illesi
non rimare che rimettersi in cammino sull'asfalto
non posso ancora accontentarmi/ ? troppo presto
lo spazio intorno/ troppo vasto
perch? intanto mi tengono in tensione
dietro volti sorridenti leggo l'intenzione
intimidirmi con l'intensit? della loro azione
so come comportarmi/ mantengo l'attenzione
devo controllarmi/ confrontarmi
tengo alto il livello di stamina
contro i nuovi mali del duemila/ formidabile
non rimane che rimare.
Ritornello (Domasan 
&
 Paura):
L'unica cosa che so/ che devo fare il rap
Angeli/ demoni mettono anime all'angolo/ come pugili
L'unica cosa che ho/ le rime che porto con me
Promettono/ mietono vittime/ prendono cuori e vite fragili.
Strofa 2 (Paura):
Non ? certo troppo facile guardarsi indietro, ma alle volte ? necessario, 
quindi quando rendo il vento fermo iberno i fin troppi pensieri neri, 
tagliandoli in tavole e agli angoli del ring sono schierati un angelo e un diavolo. 
Il troppo bene e il troppo male estremizzato e forse ? il mio stato allucinato 
che ha annullato il divario. 
E' normale che in queste condizioni non conviene neanche lontanamente 
prendere in considerazione il risultato. 
Oramai sono abituato a fare l'arbitro con l'abito sporco di sangue 
e rido in faccia ai concorrenti, anche se so che corrono senza freni, senza favole: 
ma la minchia mi scoppia se fanno i sensei. 
Ogni loro alunno cresce deviato come un neonato che ? stato adottato a vita 
da una coppia di gay. 
Oramai non si evita pi?: 
questo millennio forse vedr? la clonazione alla nascita per il ricambio degli organi umani. La legalizzazione di tutte le sostanze stupefacenti, 
e pi? che fattanze vedo veleno su un tavolo. 
Gi? lo senti che certe cibarie sono identiche a droghe sintetiche. 
Quando si confondono l'estate e l'inverno, si propongono soluzioni antitetiche. 
E in eterno noi siamo fottuti da dosi anestetiche. 
Se apri quelle cazzo di palpebre lo vedi che in giro ci sono anche fin troppi uomini strani. 
Alcuni insegnamenti sono studiati per manipolare le menti 
e le mie risposte nascoste tra gli elementi. 
Piani correlati ad anello. 
Demoni di metano e di plastica con tatuata la svastica e falce e martello.
Un monaco tibetano me lo disse che, oltre la facciata, nulla ? pi? considerato un tab?. Vien vien cu'me. Ma soltanto quando, in primis, tu vien vien cu'te. 
Sono fiere materializzate dalle rime sul mio quaderno 
e pi? che Ulisse nell'Odissea, 
mi sento un cavaliere dell'apocalisse che vola sulle ciminiere, 
quando schiere di soldati alieni offuscano il cielo come l'eclisse. 
Non sono le risse ne il governo che decidono adesso al mondo 
chi cazzo detiene il potere. 
Sul teleschermo immagini di guerre in terre straniere, 
ma per lo pi? non credo a quello che viene trasmesso in tv. 
Ho smesso da un bel p? di stare appresso alle cazzate che abbiamo attorno ogni giorno. Orami so che conviene passarci in mezzo indifferente, 
la differenza con prima ? che sono molto pi? diffidente. 
Non mi vedrai mai in compagnia dei comitati a cui ti affidi, 
sono afidi che si attaccano alla tua mente, sfiaccano la tua gente 
e alla fine ti lasciano in ipocondria. 
Avviati alle olimpiadi di chi ama l'anarchia ma sembra adesso uscito 
da un programma di Mtv. 
Mentiti finch? vuoi, se vuoi dimenticami.
Ricami per il tuo identikit oppure vai m?.

Strofa 3 (Paura):
Rimango io l'oblio e la strategia, lento ma prendo progresso che vendo. 
Altro che pariamiento questa ? pura follia,
questo ? l'avvento come il messia, ? un giorno nuovo e m? si dia il via 
all'era del flusso e dalla stratosfera, 
tredici in possesso dei codici d'accesso. 
Ridotto all'osso, inizia la primavera perenne. 
Prima era indenne ma adesso l'hip hop in agonia per me ? un ossesso. 
Lascia la scia del successo e trova armonia. Con me sempre pi? spesso. 
Per te ? tab?. 
L'epidemia inizia dalla grafia mia su un foglio del mio menu. 
Non c'? compromesso, ? poesia. 
Precauzione per la feccia 
ed i cloni coi loro emblemi. 
Sciami di scemi, milioni che si intrecciano come le frecce che sfrecciano 
sui vagoni dei treni. 
E' una magia, le emissioni ? quello che temi. E cos? sia. Soluzioni per i problemi. Inesistenti le proporzioni, tu non ti opponi. 
E tra i perdenti addirittura c'? chi si svia. 
Interi contingenti di contendenti, armati di oggetti contundenti. 
Pane per i tuoi denti. Per me oramai ? una mania. 
Per ogni loro gesto una eresia, e sono in fuga come i conigli. 
Consigli dalla regia, lavori di fantasia ma rimani in balia delle onde 
prima che tocchi le sponde della realt?. 
D'altronde ? la mia fonte d'energia che confonde i motori, li manda in avaria. 
Asfissia e non c'? luce all'orizzonte. 
Pensavi di stare sulle corazzate dei russi? 
Le tue restano cazzate pure se ne smussi gli angoli. Manco li vedi passare i miei flussi. Solo arrestandoli avanzi di categoria. 
E poi testandoli capisci che si tratta gi? di antologia. 
La sacrosanta verit?: tra noi due non ci sar? mai sintonia. 
Non ? l'assenza di gravit? che alza quintali. 
Spinti oltre la sfera dei venti in prevalenza da correnti ascensionali. 
Per gli incompetenti eventi sovrannaturali, noi coerenti a degli ideali. 
In queste cose vai avanti soltanto se vali, validit? a vita, 
i movimenti delle dita dei djs: fuochi artificiali, no replay. 
I breakers fanno danze tribali. 
Mcs stregoni col dilay. Vitalit?. 
Idoneit?, predisposizioni naturali. 
In queste discipline ti imbatti in guerrieri senza rivali, trattasi di imbattibilit?!

Strofa 1 (Callister):
La magia viene da un vicoletto stretto 
dove c'? un ciuccio con il carretto un cioccio a cobretto. 
Come i tiri di Maradona con l'effetto, 
stai fottendo con il mostro finale lo hai detto! 
Come per una mossa speciale rotazione, 
stai fottendo con Callister il ciclone! 
Temperatura a mille la capocchia fa scintille mentalit? 
da macchinista struttura da terrorista 
sgancio missili terra aria fottono lo testa 
i ciocci abbassano la cresta. 
Macchinetta lesta la mia mascin ha la sesta, 
rimani dietro come nesta.
Basta che la storia di merda si tasta 
e la gente di merda ? rimasta!
Strofa 2 (Dj Gruff):
Ma che ne so arriva un tipo e mi fa: 
"vado bene di qua, sto venendo di l?, 
e ho pensato che lei mi potesse indicar 
un piazza provvista di pusher da poter acquistar".
Io lo guardo un bel p? gli faccio capire che: "boh!" 
Lui fa finta di nulla con la mossa di uno che sta malato di hip-hop, 
intrippato di rap, calato di trip,
la faccia di chi ? appena uscito da un bar in cerca di un cespuglio con la spugna. 
Poi si mette a gridar come un pazzo a pazzo agitando le mani sporche di spray, 
si ? sparato un wholecar con lo sfondo di blu, l'outline che lo segue come un'ombra! 
Poi si piazza un throw up e cos? come ? arrivato il tipo se ne va 
Strofa 3 (Paura): 
Vengo da Napoli provincia. 
Ordine del pariamiento con Callister e Cast?, la storia comincia quando 
tu non sapevi neppure cos'era il flow 
oppure facevi ridere e dicevi che stavi ancora imparando. 
La verit? ? che tipi come noi qui non ce n'? 
e non ce n'? mai stato. 
In pista il team pi? potenziato. Tu al massimo puoi fare l'apprendista. 
Sar? un disgraziato a dirtelo, 
ma ho la lista di ogni volta che ti ho distanziato. 
Strofa 4 (Domasan):
Pupazzi/ cuori ingrati/ disintegrati come palazzi
Rumore di vetri in mille pezzi
Tigri in gabbia/ sangue a spruzzi
Mangiatoti di sabbia/ citano la bibbia/ verit? a sprazzi
Stretti ai muri come arazzi/ pensieri folli gi? come foglie
Giudica meglio certi scherzi
Per mancanza di spazi si tramutano in screzi
? un puzzle per pazzi.

Melchiorre in citt?

Solita notte straleso, peniello acceso per strada preso bene, penso: "sto posto ? ostile", per? sto a posto ho stile, tecnica, flow, rime, do merda che ? concime
conci i ciocci con le medicine. 
Rimedi decine di aspetti, decidi i codici, sleghiamoci dai nodi che ci danno! 
Raggi di sole oscuri a prezzi modici, affanno, e tra i palazzi 
fanno di noi mazzi, singoli come cazzi, simboli mai sazi, dispari gli spazi 
colpi bassi ripari agli spari coi sassi. 
Si assiste agli stessi sorpassi. 
Spiragli di merda a spirale i cazzotti che incassi dai pazzi. 
In azione: 
tririce bastard, dj gruff, dj 2phast, dj tay one, ? uno svarione!
Strofa 8 (Joz):
Basta l'appartenenza, up and down per la scena 
questa ? la band testane la presenza e
i diversi versi per silenzi immersi di segni,
sogni divisi da sorsi, verit? nascoste nei silenzi.
La professione di premere il tasto enter sul processore,
professore mi processi una volta e per tutte di dire cazzate, 
lasciando tag nei cessi delle autostrade,
prede allo stato brado,
pietre di fumo su un prato di weeda su carta da parato.
Non mi sono mai parato,
n? nato imparato, mai comprato a rate nella Nato,
passato giornate su giornali,
la notizia non gira in gita in un articolo di un apparente agitato
che vende in edicola coca e cervelli in scatola, 
da un naso che cola che vola a fine rigo 
appena finito una striscia punto a capo
suona sempre bene se si combina in una cabina
con un microfono puntato..

Senza Offesa 
Strofa 1 (Joz):
Senza offesa dell'essenza forse me ne frega,
prega sfrega ma riguardati, stregami ma sappi che non sono in rotta,
anche se la rota torna puntuale,
scappando su tacchi a nasconder fianchi pacchi a chi come fausto fusto,
con giochi sleali nosi macchi ingegni marchi ciocci e vuoi proporti.
Parto per nuovi porti non traffico su marmi in macchine rombanti con pippotti,
amo solo mamm?!
Romantico amore per un mestiere antico come il mondo
zappo con una zeppa in un locale pieno zeppo, 
un fiacco a fianco zuppo, sono tre ore che ti darei fuoco con una zippo.
Ma non mi attizza chi cala come Jerry, 
sono finiti i mon cherry ed hai preso dei rosch al posto dei ferrero roch?, 
andresti nel tre con una stecca di perry,
o con un testo che tocca un tasto scontato, 
un pretesto scemo per abbordare una signorina che si inceppa nell'esprimere concetti,
una mente come cioccolato fondente, pensieri su di un infante
che non ha l'et? come Gigliola Cinguetti, 
e se apre bocca e da chiudergliela con la sgagliola.
Sai che c'? ? un knock out sulla psiche, 
ho un tot di amiche che sanno che non ? la stessa cosa in fondo.
Ho detto scio' ad un orda balorda che balla strisciando addosso una vrenzola 
detta la mecca del mondo,
capitata per caso sotto le mie lenzuola a casa. 
Adesso bevo di meno,
ne cerco una con la testa meno intasata di nome non fa sofisticata in giornata!

Do amore, prendo amore
e tu non punti al sentimento,non sei nata per me
Se sei troppo orgogliosa e dici sempre "io ti chiamer?",
ma ogni giorno sono io a fare il tuo numero.
La vita tua ? fatta a segreti e poi tutte bugie 
e non ? vero che le colpe sono tutte mie.
Tieni sempre qualcosa che ti manca,

esteso alle bucchine, bucchine, punto ai buchi delle bucchine, 
sono super potenziato oltre il confine, 
quando la merda e rovente, 
vengo come Sirio con il colpo segreto del drago nascente, 
danza come Jim sulla strada del serpente il tuo culo sul mio cazzo incandescente.

No One 
Did you misunderstand me when, 
I stoped and said hello again?
Smile act just like you did back then,
help me Im falling in again.
Oh.. how eyes roll...
Turned back you dont know.
But now I know you will.
No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day!
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because Im no one!
No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day!
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because Im no one!
Dont you judge or question me,
I'm still feeling misery.
Last chance, now take a look at me,
my soul, I feel it scattering.
Chrome.. a hollow tip.. a sigh I wave goodbye,
and now you understand.
No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day!
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because Im no one!No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day!
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because I'm no one.. because I'm no one.. because I'm no one.. because I'm no one!!
See now I'm alone...
Self pity my own...
Swallow the bullet whole...
A passage of truth...
See now I'm alone...
Self pity my own...
Swallow the bullet whole...
A passage of truth...
Know.. I walk alone.. straight into unknown...
No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day.
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because Im no one!No one gets away,
Ill make you pay.
Fuck up another day.
Hold hostility in,
with a grin because I'm no one.. because I'm no one.. because I'm no one.. because I'm no one!!

Bred In The Bone 
Didn't you want to place
Didn't you want to show
No you've got a disease
And it's laid you low
(Laid you low)
If you had it in you
What you had before
You could pick yourself up
Up off of the floor
(Laid you low)
What's come over you
What could it be
Does it have a name
An identity
(Laid you low)
Do you need a doctor
The head of surgery
Do you want a dealer
Who'd give you shit for free
(Laid you low)
CHORUS
What's bred in the bone
Has laid you low

Dirty Little Rat 
(John Critchley)
Dirty little rat, never could get it straight
The man upstairs says he doesn't care
If you live 'til daylight
Dirty little rat
Get your coat, get your hat
We're gonna take a ride tonight
My sweet baby boy, born under circumstance
I'm gonna give you all I got to give you a chance
Sweet baby boy
You're going to understand
Someday you'll be a man
Something inside snapped
I stil ldon't understand
The deal went down, I looked around
I was left holding the bag
Something inside cracked
The deal went down, I looked around
And now here I am

Going Under 
I hear the door slam shut, so I know that you're home
You've been out all night, I've been here alone
And I've been wondering if you're the same person I knew
The bright lights that shine in your eyes, they make me blind
I hear a footstep on the stairs so I know that you're near
You've returned from pursuing your nocturnal career
And I don't ask where you've been, with who, or if they're your friend
'Cause I don't really want to know right now, I don't know when I will again
CHORUS
Going under, drifting down, going under
And I know you've still got a ways to go down before
We can rise back up into the light
We're going under, drifting down...
I hear you coughing in the hall so I know you're all right
It will be morning soon, through the gloom I see daylight
But in this room right now I am alone, I am unsure
I don't know what you feel anymore and it scares me so
CHORUS

Lift You Up 
(John Critchley)
Your mind is all cluttered now
But you drag yourself along somehow
Through dark dreams of that visit you in the night
Obscure fragments with broad daylight
Watch me now
What did you say about what I've done
What do you want to know, why or how come?
Haven't you learned yet that it never ends
Back and forth and around, here it comes again
CHORUS
Watch me now
And I'll lift you up if I can
Watch me now
You're eyes are wild and your nerves exposed
But you haven't lost anything, not by a mile, not yet
Can yo uremember the good times
They can be back soon, better than before
CHORUS

Moment Of Clarity 
(John Critchley)
I remember, one November we had our picnic
At the graveyard down your street
On the bodies under our feet
And the cold grey ancient autumn ships
Looked down without a frown
It laughed down without a sound
While the sun hit her face in disgrace
She doesn't see the competition from the human race
Competition from the human race
And now you're wondering, where's it going to end
And now you're wondering, could we begin again
While the laser of immortality, it burns through
All our memories, it cuts through what we want to see
As we spin on our axes
A moment of clarity is all that's required of me
